# The Return ..

The village was in a state of shock when `Satyawati` made it to the docks. `Maharishi` had fixed her boat that it looked like new. `Matsya` was long gone from the memory of this village. She docked her boat and turned to a group of fishermen who were looking at her in disbelief — Is there a place to stay in this village and also who is the village head here? I wanted to seek permission to moor my boat in this dock.

The fishermen were speechless. They had never seen a more beautiful woman and her fragrance was driving them crazy. One of them offered her food that his wife had packed. Other offered to take her to the village head. 

The village head — `Dashraaj` in mid seventies, had seen the life long enough to be enchanted from anything glittering. Or at least that was what he thought. His ideas were forcefully changed by `Maharishi` but at the core, he still thought he had a role to play. His week eyes couldn't see `Satyawati` well enough, but he couldn't resist the smell. It was as if some Goddess stepped into his home. He stood up in respect and offered a seat and water to `Satyawati`. When she sought his permission to dock the boat, he didn't think twice. `Satyawati` saw the power of fragrance firsthand. She was happy. She kept on — Is there a place I could rent to stay. I have some gold. 

The word “gold” rang a pleasant bell in `Dashraaj's` ear — you are village's responsibility. You don't need to spend a penny. You are like a daughter to me, why don't you stay with us. I have three daughters who could help you on the boat.

The news of arrival of a beautiful noblewoman had already spread in the village. Men and women stopped at whatever they were doing and flocked to village head's home. Everyone was eager to help a single beautiful woman. Some applauded her for navigating rough `Yamuna` alone. `Satyawati` was stunned in the change. How could same set of people ignore poor `Matsyagandha`? It felt like `Matsya` actually died. Something in her told her she needed more power. Power to rule the entire world. She will never be as exposed and as needy as `Matsya` was. She must build on her gifts. She however, was not sure if the desires were taking over her if that was the right thing to do. May be `Krishna` would answer that one day! — she thought.

After few days of rest and enjoying cooked food, `Satyawati` returned to her boat. Along with her three `Dashraaj` girls. The older one slightly older than her and youngest slightly younger. Middle one was her age. They offered to help her on the boat. She was back in business as she saw a line of commuters growing to board her boat. She smiled and a song came to her lips. Life could be much easier for the rich and beautiful — she thought. The thought was soon replaced by the memory of `Krishna`. Every success must be paid in some form, some pain. She reminded herself that `Krishna` was with `Maharishi`. He couldn't have asked for a better father.

Time took the wings again.

`Satyawati's` boat got popular — like a tourist attraction.  People started pouring over just see her and listen to her sing.  And of course the fragrance. She got rich but she was still waiting for the next season of `Maharishi's` prediction. `Dashraaj` declared her as his daughter. There were many suitors who would happily surrender their lives' worth for `Satyawati`, but none of them could make her “rule the world”. More importantly, she was curious of the bigger cause that `Maharishi` said she was a part of. For now, she was content with love and respect that she know not existed. And she kept on sharpening her skills — music, singing, looking good and of course smelling good.

Back to his `Ashrama`, there was a welcome celebration for `Maharishi` and `Krishna`. No one asked about the mother for they were all busy checking out the toddler who could already speak broken `Sanskrit`. He had the `Gaytri Mantra` by heart. `Maharishi Parāśara` always kept him with in his eyes. Young `Krishna` was curious. He asked even more questions than his mother. `Maharishi` always eager to respond to him. He learnt music, dance and finally the astrology. One thing always laid heavy on `Maharishi's` mind — `Krishna's` learning was only through words. He hadn't seen the life yet. Where would life take him? What all he must go through to be able to nail the truth!.

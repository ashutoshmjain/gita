Krishna Dvaipayana was born for a purpose. He was destined to write (or compile) , the sacred texts into four Vedas. Before his time, Vedas were probably passed on as `Shruti` -- The spoken word. Or may be written down as one off text-- half baked, grammatically incorrect and contextually incoherent. This was the first time humanity wanted to organize world's information. But they found a better way. Instead of crunching all the text and the spoken word, they first invested an Intelligent means to understanding the meaning - the meaning of the reality itself. Krishna was such an intelligence. The program was designed by Rishi Parashara. And it's an immortal agent.

To commission such intelligence, the physical reality itself must be sandboxed. It had to be an island in the middle of `Yamuna` - the mighty river. A single woman must take Rishi Parashara in the middle of the `Yamuna`, and without any prior knowledge, must agree to bear an intelligence of her womb. `Matsyagandha` happened to be there when `Parashara` summoned the boat. When `Parashara` looked at her, he found most beautiful woman ever. He thought it a good omen--Gods wanted him to unleash this intelligence. He, however, under-estimated the poise of `Matsyagandha`. She wouldn't indulge in this crazy bio-intelligence experiment without any securities. 

- All the actions must be completely hidden to the external world - She demanded. And that is exactly what `Parashara` wanted. He authorised 'Zero Visibility' protocol on the sandboxed island. But that was not all for `Matsyagandha`. She wanted her virginity information restored and also wanted a new identity. This was something `Parashar` didn't expect. He consulted with Ganesha - his editor for this 'Knowledge Extraction' project. Ganesha helped him open the door to identity cloud to accommodate this anomaly.

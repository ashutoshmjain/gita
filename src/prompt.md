## Stanza specific Instructions:

- Stanza 1: In previous episode chapter 11, Krishna gave the blueprint of devotion - Five steps - Do all actions unto me, Make me your supreme goal, Be my devotee i.e. follow me every step of the way, abstain from clinging attachments, and finally equanimity to all beings. The natural question then for Arjuna is - What do you mean when you say the word "me" ? Having seen the infinite divine form of Krishna, the obvious question for Arjuna is who should I dedicate my actions to - Krishna as infinite unmanifest divine or Krishna as he sees in human form?
- Stanza 2 : motivate the question - what is the difference between manifest and unmanifest. Unmanifest is the seed - the potential for all the possibilities. Krishna is the reference manifestation. That is why he is referred to as `Purushottama` - the ideal human form. Think of praying the unmanifest as writing code from scratch i.e. painful, whereas devoting to Krishna is like leveraging well tested libraries, using established tools and frameworks.
- Stanza 3: The beauty is Krishna exhibits multitude of complex roles - there are choices available to fix your devotion. You can pray him as an infant born to incarcerated parents, or one raised in another family yet the most favorite child, a divine musician of flute, a cherished dance partner of `Gopies`, a saviour of village from floods, a youth conqueror of city of `Mathura`,  and one who left it all behind - without skipping a beat, and one who went on to build divine city `Dwarka`, and a charioteer to a friend who gave up all his armies to the opposite side. And finally one who stood in the middle of the biggest war but didn't pick up a single weapon. 
- Stanza 4: This is the path of an aspiring Yogi. One who is already started the journey. The highest stage is mind fully reposed in Krishna, and the beginner is one who gives up fruits of all their actions to Krishna. While the highest state is somewhat abstract, the idea of doing all the work for Krishna is simple. You can serve a temple, write books on Krishna , sing his glories. If even that is not possible, then whatever you do, donate all your earnings to cause of Krishna.
- Stanza 5 : This stanza is for the people who haven't yet resolved to follow Krishna's path. Who are still struggling to make sense of this world. To them message is clear - Pursue knowledge over pure physical labor. Try to focus your mind on divine rather than just intellectual pursuits. And finally learn to sacrifice the fruits of actions. For example : The open source projects where developers give away their code without any monetary gains. Some of them do it anonymously even giving up recognition. This is the place where we transition from a worldly person to Yogi. In essence, Karmyoga is right at the boundary that marks the transition.
- Stanza 6: Having given the path, Krishna reveals what does an accomlished Yogi looks like. When should you know that you have attained mastry on this path.
- Stanza 7: The key idea is such a person is not mere a devotee, he is expert in his duty. Or rather the very meaning of devotion is to do your duty well.
- Stanza 8: Who gives his all to me. In chapter 8 we learnt the lord is enjoyer of all sacrifices. These sacrifices begin with a flower or water. But the culminate with sacrificing our entire being. 
- Stanza 9: And this sacrifice of self is not even a hard choice, because when we get the taste of the divine nector, all other worldly things appear puny.

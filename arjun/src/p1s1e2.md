> In Hindu Scriptures, we come across something called `Nad Yoga` - Yoga of recital and chanting. Nad Yoga is basically a set of techniques to focus on the sounds. Sounds that come from the universe to our ears are called `Aahata` which means hurt or decayed. The sounds that are inside us are called `Anahta` or the sounds that are pure and unhurt. As per `Hath Yoga` - both of these types are controlled by the `vrittis` of the heart Chakra - also called `Anahta`.  Stabilizing this Chakra basically means building an ability that may allow us to hear our internal sounds.  So Nadyoga starts with focusing on externally chanted mantras with deep focus on the words. A solid understanding of the meaning and how the word is spoken. And then trying to catch what we feel about the word and the sentence and the overall context. That is Nad Yoga. We practice Nad Yoga with external chanting  in the beginning; this could be a Mantra, a well written article, a sermon or a poetical recital. The core idea is to focus on every said word and contemplate our reactions to the recitation. Whatever they may be. Good or bad. We practice Nad Yoga gradually over years till we are able to see the calling of our emotions also called `Anahat Naada`. In essence, once we are able to hear all our internal emotions, analyse them , undertand them , then only we can control the words we speak. We will check out the spoken "words" in next episode along with role of throat Chakra on our well being.

> So this attempt is to focus on the words of `Karm Yoga` as told by Krishna to Arjuna in Bhagvad Gita. An intense discusson on the very core ieas of `Karm Yoga`. In a way, I am trying to use `Nad Yoga` to learn or evoke my internal responses to `Karm Yoga`.

### 3.4

Na [not] Karmnaam [of righteous action] Anarambhan [the ones that are never initiated] Naishkarmyam [a stage where one is beyond actions - such as Krishna] Purushah [a man] Ashnute [one who achived said stage];

{A man doesn't achieve the stage where she is beyond actions by the actions that are never started}

(In essence - you can only get freedom from actions by acting on some actions - the ones you didn't even start are not helping you accomplish this stage)

Na [nor] Cha [also] Sannyasnat [one who has renounced everything, towards them] eva [] Siddhim [distinguisable success] Sam-adhigacchti [easily goes towards].

{Nor distinguishable success goes towards the ones who have renounced everything}

(In essence - we all want to get to a stage where we can get everything we desire without doing anything - `Naishkarmya` - Some of us try to get there by pursuit of knowledge ie automation and others by renunciation ie "why have it" ; Krishna says that you can't get to this stage by not starting the action. Actions are mandatory requirement)

### 3.5

Na [nor] Hi [certainly] Kashchit [anyone] Kshnam [a moment] Api [too] Jatu [at any time] Tishthati [stays - sit down] Akaram Krit [doing nothing];

{Its not like someone can sit idle. They are perforced into actions by their nature}

> jātasya—for one who has been born; hi—for; dhruvaḥ—certain; mṛityuḥ—death; dhruvam—certain; janma—birth; mṛitasya—for the dead; cha—and; 

Krishna said in verse 27 of chapter 2 that all things born in truth must die and out of the death in truth comes life. This kinda hints at the cyclic reality of our being. In previous article, where we hypothesised the postulates of Gita , we went through a numbered list that we are all endowed with a protected, immutable but encrypted copy of knowledge. We also dwelled on the idea that `Bramh` - an overarching  system, provisions everything - our "tiny box". In addition, it also implements a superior garbage collection system. But we left an important point open that the  underlying reality is a continuum. There is no beginning or an end. It's an everlasting cycle of knowledge to manifestation and vice-versa. This cycle is also called `Kaal Chakra` - the cycle of "Time". Each cycle expresses a specific aspect of "Knowledge". These cycles of Time are scale invariant - i.e they may express an entire Universe or a single atom or even a quark inside an atom. The journey of human life or for that matter any other manifestation is thus too a cycle of Time. 

In Hindu scriptures , the cycle of "Time" is defined as the four `Yugas` "Eons" - `Sattva, Treta, Dwapra and Kali` . These four phases are part of any cycle - a human life , a business organization , a race , a society or a country. All naturally existing systems follow the same pattern of four Eons with varying duration for each. The things are not that different when we approach this cycle from scientific vantage. In fact the ideas of religion and science had never been closer to each other when it comes to defining the life cycle of our universe. However, the important thing is not the phases or the durations of each phase. I say this because religious side is kinda hung up on order  and the scale. The important thing is evolution of these phases with Time . In a way Time is inseparable from the cycle, yet , it remains the biggest mystery !

## Time

I don' think you will be surprised if I said we all are living at the edge of the time. And "all" includes everything - big or small. The stars , galaxies and of course the chair that you are sitting on. None of us can jump ahead in time even by a tiny bit. Why ? Because edge of "time" is NOT a spatial edge. There is no place to jump to. It simply unfolds on us. Still science is very clear that we can move faster or slower in time because we live in a four dimensional world where time is as much as dimension as any other spatial dimension. Einstein adopted this idea in relativity as "Proper Time" - the flow of time experienced by a body in space-time. My proper time can be different from you and is very sure different from Earth and bigger stars. 

To better understand time, let us use established principles. With these principles, we are now much better placed to understand Time . Thanks to the work of countless thinker and scientists, it seems like "Time" is now with in bounds of our knowledge. As a matter of fact, Time is not spatial ; it is an aspect of "Knowledge-verse".


One of the tested and proven  scientific truth is our universe has a strange love with a speed of ~ 300K Km  per second - often represented as "C" - the speed of light. It is only a convention that we call it "speed of light" because "C" has nothing special for light more than it has for me and you. We all , and this all includes "light" too, move at this speed in "space-time". It is a "constant" or a fundamental property of our universe. This fact is a proven truth and equally acceptable to both Relativity and Quantum Mechanics - that everything in our universe must move at at ~300K per sec in space-time.

The key word here is we are saying "space-time" NOT "space" alone. If something moves at this speed spatially then their motion in time is zero. We know this is true because photons move at "C" in space. Thus they don't move at all in time. As our speed in space starts reducing to normal level (like us humans), we start contributing the difference towards our motion in Time. This means that Photons generated at the time of big bang (some 13.8 Billion years ago) are still around somewhere in the space. Though they are very very old and may be lost in the mess of photons being created from our light bulbs. Thus light (photons) are information. Nothing really ever dies in the realm of information though it does get very very old and kinda lose itself in the jungle of new information. And this is exactly why we complain about "information overload" :-) The good news is scientist are getting smarter by the day to identify these old photons from the new ones and that tells us a lot about the beginning of universe. The scientific name for these old photons sounds like a super hit Hollywood movie - "The cosmic microwave radiations". In a way, travel back in time is quite possible because the all the information of past is always available. It is only matter of being able to identify and conceptualize the old information. This has been true of `Yogies` that they move freely in past and as we progress in technology it shall be accessible to all. Virtual worlds where you could explore your past - how your cities , neighborhoods looked like say twenty years back. What happened on the first day of your school.  I say this because if we can explore the beginning of universe to the order of 10^-34 second - that too with technology of last century, why wouldn't you have google maps with time dimension on them. 

So we know for sure that travel back in time is possible. May be we will recreate it from our memories , just like the old books, question is can we move faster in time ? The truth is there are exotic places in this universe that move faster in time than what I and you perceive. Let me show you how ..

Let us use another proven idea, we know heavier objects move slower in the space. For example Earth moves slower than the Moon. Because moon not only moves around earth , it also moves with Earth around the sun. Same is true about Earth and Sun. Earth not only rotates around Sun , but it also moves with the Sun around the Black hole at the center of Milky way. In essence, we see that objects with higher mass (or Energy) have a lesser spatial motion. This is true from relativistic standpoint too. We know when something with non zero mass tries to gain extensive speed - say comparable to speed of light - the system must increase its energy (or mass ) to slow it down. Its a bit tricky because sensationalism has cropped up into science too. It is lot more fun to say - "your mass increases if you move fast - and it does exponentially when you get closer to speed of light" but the fact is this mass increase is to slow the thing down so that it could never cross the sacrosanct value of "C". In essence - increase in energy slows down our spatial motion. 

The other way to think about it is that if something reduces its spatial motion, its Energy increases. Hold this thought and let me throw one more basic principle in the mix here . And this one is from Thermodynamics. We know, to move from a "disorderly state" to a "state of order" - what is normally referred to as decrease in entropy of the system, the energy of the system increases. Thus its mass increases. When we get from disorder to order, the energy must increase. It is somewhat similar to reducing the spatial motion. Thus we can say reduction of spatial speed is akin to reduction of disorder and hence it leads to increase in mass. 

And here is the key thing, as we reduce the spatial speed, our speed in Time increase. Means we move faster in time. Consider the graphic below for a better representation of the ideas above . For simplicity , this graphic ignores the bending of space due to gravity. 

![](./circleOfC.jpg)


In popular science, you must have seen the pictures where they show massive objects bending a flat surface such that the things on the orbit fall towards them. Sadly , it is just an analogy. A very useful way to represent space-time but we know it is a mere representation that massive things - by design - are better organized - they have less disorder - which simply means they attract the lighter things towards them. In a way, we want to follow things that are ahead of us in Time. For example - Einstein was light years ahead of his time. Even now, after 100 years , we are trying to catch up with him. As we said above , time is an aspect of knowledge-verse. A spatial representation is good if it helps but it must not be taken literally. Space doesn't bend. It does contain more massive , less disorderly things. And those entities are ahead of us in Time because better organised things have more "Knowledge". 

The best way to say this is simply - less disorder has more mass and we know mass attracts. The "bending of space-time metaphor" may work when we are trying to explain the gravity to elementary school but how do you explain why the things compress themselves towards their center ? It is really hard to visualize bending of space-time with in Earth herself. Thus it is best to say "higher degree of order attracts". Higher degree of order is nothing but potential energy. It also means it is a way to pack information in the lowest possible volume. Information packed in the lowest possible volume is an expression of "Knowledge".


#### Cycle of Knowledge to Manifestation

If something moves faster in time , the space around it seems contracted. This is what leads to curvature of space-time. Things appear to start falling towards such an entity. We named it gravity. Now we try to explain Gravity through above said curvature in space-time. It is often said that since space is curved around massive bodies, things tend to fall into a more massive body. It works well as far as no one questions as to why do we fall lower. And it also becomes hard to explain as to why do massive things want contract. We know that gravity not only pulls Earth towards the Sun, but also pulls itself towards it's center. It becomes hard to use curvature of space-time with in a massive body itself. It will hard to visualize that space-time is somehow curved with earth too - between every single atom of earth. Thus the analogy kinda falls apart. 

A better way to understand gravity as a force that leads things from state of higher disorder to lower disorder. In other words , gravity is matter's tendency to better organize itself. It is way to pack information in the increasingly smaller possible volume. For the manifestations to decrypt the knowledge hidden in them and to build a template of one aspect of knowledge. A template that could be easily replicated . It is a cycle of "Knowledge to manifestation".

The phenomenon is visible in all things matter. Galaxies shape up to withstand the cosmic chaos. With in them stars become more orderly. Things fall into orderly solar systems. Complex molecules are formed leading to biological life. And here we are trying to grasp this vast play of "Knowledge to Manifestation". The cycle is ever present and everlasting. Ever more information is packed into ever more exotic manifestations to express different aspects of knowledge.


### Cycle of Manifestation to Knowledge.

One of the observation of the  graphic above is as the matter moves from disorder to order i,e reduction in spatial velocity - its velocity in time increases. In popular science, there is lot of conversation about moving at the speed of light in space but very little conversation about motion at the speed of light in Time. Such situation calls for "absolute rest" in the space that defies the idea of everlasting quest. As we discussed "Quest" or motion is the fundamental property of universe. If something is absolutely stationary, it doesn't exist, In our normal experience, getting to absolute rest is as impossible as getting to infinite speed in space. The max spatial speed attainable (by photons) is our lucky number 300K Km per sec. 

Turns out such a limit does exist in terms of how much orderly a system might get. In our universe, electrons are probably the lowest mass particles. If we try to squish two electrons into a Planck length (order of 10^-35) the energy required for such an order would make that space a black hole. Obviously, packing so much energy into such little space is impossible but the this phenomenon may occur in super massive stars. When a massive star bursts under its own gravity , the core may gain too much energy in comparatively smaller space that the packed density get enormously high. Such a formation - black hole - quickly lose their spatial motion and start moving entirely in time. 

The black holes were predicted by the General Theory of Relativity but major work was done by Stephen Hawkings. His work shows that even though Black Holes are made in a most violent process imaginable - bursting of a massive star - at billions of degrees of nuclear heat - still Black holes are among the coldest places in the universe. Their temperature is couple degrees above absolute zero and entropy is very low. They may appear scary places that may eat away any thing on their course , yet they are most orderly central entities of our universe. 

This huge mass packed into a tiny space, brings their spatial motion to zero. More and more black holes observed till date comply with zero spatial motion though there are few aberrations. These could be due to the fact that space itself is expanding. Such extensions are the cause of galaxies drifting apart but on occasions it may also make galaxies collide. In such events black holes may merge into each other forming binary black hole pairs that may move in space. But such observations are rare and are not yet proven. The science that we have to date , shows that Black holes are stationary in space. And hence all their motion is in Time. 



----

The next question is what is the mechanism for transition from disorder to order - The idea of manifested matter. What exactly is matter ? We know matter is made of Protons, Neutrons and Electrons. The matter-ishness - commonly called mass, mostly comes from Protons and Neutrons cuz electrons are very low in mass compared to first two. If we break the Protons and Neutrons further down the elementary particles are called "Quarks". Normally there are three quarks in protons and same number in Neutron each but no one knows for sure because Quarks themselves are probability waves - mater waves, just like electrons as we saw above in section on matter waves. The reason we are talking about matter and mass here is this is the way something may slow down its motion in space and hence start moving in time.

The quarks are essentially a repetitive orderly motion. This orderly motion, in itself is an interference patten of matter waves but that pattern is not something that lends it its energy (or mass). Pattern gains mass because it is a reduction of disorder of matter waves. This order may also be called specific pattern of vibrations in the strings of string theory. This specific vibration is the quantum of knowledge. 

This increase in order gives birth to strong force with in the nucleus. The beauty of this orderly design is what attracts the electron to the nucleus and this attraction is expressed through week force. But the story doesn't end here. The atoms bond with others to form the molecules. Design pattern keeps repeating in formation of solids , liquids and air. Further improvement in order gives rise to complex proteins and hence the biological life. 



An unintended consequence of this mass formation is these particles bend the space around them. In a way they are tiny balls kept on a rubber sheet. So the curvature of our 2 dimensional space changes and we get a notion of three dimensional space around the manifested objects. However this analogy of rubber sheet with balls of mass bending it down - and heavier objects such as starts kinda making a well of gravity is misleading. It is only a spatial representation. If we turn it upside down, then the massive objects are what pulling us towards the future. In other words Gravity is a force that takes us to the future. From spatial perspective a massive object is a well of gravity because things naturally fall towards order; but this massive object is ahead of its surroundings in terms of time because it is contributing most of its motion towards the time. 

The next obvious question is - can we go back in time?.  Why ? Now this is a profound idea. Technically , travelling back in time should be possible because quantum Mechanics deems "Time" directionless - Means you can move back in time as long as you respect the speed limits. But if you noticed from our conversation on the "Quest" in the first part of this post, our quest is unidirectional. Because we don't want to search the signals that we already did. Thus the entire set up is for the waves of future to come to our senses .This apparatus has developed over billions of years. We are simply a future seeking species. The nature of our Quest makes the "time" unidirectional. And hence we can't jump back in time. 


An easier way to imagine our "life at the edge" of time is to think our universe is made of trillions of balloons. Each one again made of trillions of them. And continue for trillions of times. If you see it holistically , it is just one large balloon. If you see at the level of photon , it is still one balloon - the tiniest possible. Now , as a moment passes , some of these balloons inflate, some of them deflate - the configuration changes -  but nothing is standstill. Every moment, every balloon is a new balloon. Just like any other manifestation , we too are new every moment. That is a good news because you can write-off all your debts of yesterday :-) But unfortunately there is an accounting system that ties us to our past (:- And that system is Time. In essence , we are not bound by spatial attractions or repulsions - we are bound by past or future locations in time. Einstein's general theory of relativity translates this motion in time to the curvature of the motion and thus the notion of the space-time is very different from what we observe with our sensory apparatus.

Now you may ask, why don't these balloons just fly away ? What binds them together ? The answer, however, right there in front of us. Just now we all agreed that nothing can jump ahead in time even a tiny bit. Not even a Photon. And every time we take a tiny step into the  future, we do need to account for the past. That clearly means "Time" is the something that keeps everything from randomly flying apart. No balloon can expand faster than the speed of information.  Einstein - like an ultimate traffic controller of our electro-magnetic universe - put a max limit to the speed of information - and that is the speed of light. Thus we can define "Time" in terms of "information".

 Time defines the axis of our observable information cone. It starts at the beginning of a manifestation and ends with the end of the manifestation. The manifestation can be a photon, an observer like us with a specific birth date and expected death date or our entire universe. Time is a mechanism to keep a track of historical information. It is the big accounting system  for eternal unidirectional quest that keeps track of "knowledge to manifestation( birth)" to "Manifestation to knowledge (death)" . Thus it accounts for both - the inflation as well as the deflation of every entity - every single balloon. However, the transition from knowledge to manifestation is timeless. And so is the transition from manifestation back to knowledge. The speed of information doesn't hold good at these two instants. 

 Science is now unanimous on the idea of "inflationary Epoch" which says that I universe expanded exponentially right after the big bang. According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflationary_epoch) ....
 
> The inflationary epoch was the period in the evolution of the early universe when, according to inflation theory, the universe underwent an extremely rapid exponential expansion. This rapid expansion increased the linear dimensions of the early universe by a factor of at least 10^26 (and possibly a much larger factor), and so increased its volume by a factor of at least 10^78. Expansion by a factor of 10^26 is equivalent to expanding an object 1 nano-meter (10−9 m, about half the width of a molecule of DNA) in length to one approximately 10.6 light years (about 62 trillion miles) long. 
>
> And all this happened between 10^-32 to 10^-36 seconds after the big bang.
>
> I guess we may very well assume that the birth of the universe should be the instant after this cosmic inflation. At big bang it was just knowledge triaging the information to find the right answers. 
>

By the same extension, though science is silent on this because we haven't yet seen the death of our universe; but we can assume that supposedly "deflationary epoch" should follow the same suite. 


Now we all have good watches to count the time between the birth and the death:-) The question really is what happens between the death and the new birth ? How does "Knowledge" separates from the manifestation and again manifests into something new.
### Time is the information field

The easiest way to imagine time as an information field is to try visualize a one dimensional line . Assume a point is wiggling from time line "T-1" to "T+1". T being the center.  Time is unidirectional upwards (future is pointing up and past is down. Plane Z indicates the time front - A frame representing "Now". You can say we have a horizontal one dimensional line and a timeline attached to every single point on that line as shown in T+1 and T-1. The job of the time line is to capture the history of the  point .  

The information is represented as "Y" and "N" . "Y" being particle is visible. "N" being particle is invisible.


![](./1dif.jpg)

So that we don't conflict with planes that connect two dimensions; lets just call our plane as "one dimensional information field". 1dif - for short. The answer that each point of 1dif records is "yes" or "No" based on the question. Question can be - Is something there ? - Answer can be a "yes" or a "no". Or the question can be - is the temperature more than 20 degrees ? - Answer can be "yes" or "no". You got it!  Time stamp only records "yes" or "no". A "zero" or a "One". An "Up" or a "Down". A "plus" or a "minus". The binary information. The question defines what does it mean when time stamp says "yes" verses a "No". In essence, the answer is written in the time line. What you are trying to figure out is a right question. 

You may ask why the point is wiggling ? Why is it not at rest ? That is a valid question. The answer is if a massless point is not wiggling , it has no information. Means it doesn't exist. In order to exist, everything must wield some information and everything that has information also has motion. Thus motion is the "information". Absolute rest is beyond "information" - no signal. You must have noticed this phenomenon in the face of your spouse when you do a late night with your friends out of the home. Absolute rest - Blank face- no information :-) And that is an ultimate test for your focus :-)

The wiggle in one dimension creates a sine wave in time. As shown in the graphic above. So our particle knows that it exists. It sure can estimate from the timeline that it is wiggling. However, this information is not very useful. All it knows is that it exists. It can't see a shape. It can't frame any meaningful question. We need some manifestation to be able to shape our quest. Means there is some work needed. But who is there to help our tiny particle in this single dimension unless it decide to help itself.

You may tend to think that it is you observing this particle. No - it is just the massless particle. Imagine this particle is entire universe. All this particle is doing is wiggling in a single dimension to know that it exist. In `Hath Yoga`, we call this point a `Bindu` - which literally means a point but a better English translation is the "Focus". In essence, this point is the unit of conciousness. The purpose of consciousness is to make sense of the information. As we noticed in our discussion in first section "Quest" that intelligence is something that spans optimum dimensions to facilitate knowledge to express itself into a manifestation.

The question now is what new dimension our particle must create and how. What is the first question that `Bindu` may ask ? Imagine you woke up from a timeless coma in the middle of nowhere. Would you like to check the weather if you don't even know who you are ? Where you are located? In a way the first intelligent question is  - "Who am I ?"  But as we agreed above, the answers are only "Yes" or "No" - means the question needs to be framed in a different way. It can ask "Am I a human?" or "Am I a chair ?" and that would be like asking -  Is it 1? Or Is it 2? . All the possible shapes or things in the universe. There must be a better way ..

Let us examine how this manifestation happens. 


### A two dimensional information field. - 2DIF

The easiest way to imagine a 2DIF is to draw two lines at right angle. Every single point of the respective information plane record the history of the particle. Choice of right angle is arbitrary. It can we any other angle but keeping it a right angle shall help us down the line when we discuss the electromagnetic field. 

![](./2dif.jpg)

Both the dimensions are feeding into one timeline. Timeline is thus the line along the intersection of two 1Difs.

The graphic shows three pairs of "Y"s . Pairs are to represent information coming from two dimensions though we could very well use only one "Y" along the time line. The central value is where the circle is just a dot but it is still a circle. The bottom and top pair is where circle is of full size. You may like to imagine this circle as a wine opener screw rotating and moving in the direction of time.


<p align="center">

  <img src="./circle.gif">

</p>  


> High School Math :- As you can see from the graphic above same sine wave oscillating perpendicular to each other is a circle in two dimensions. In high school math lingo we call these two sines at a phase difference of 90 degrees or if you were a trigonometry buff , you already know these are sine and cosine waves. 

By projecting itself into an additional dimension, the information took a shape - a circle. A pattern emerged in the ocean of bits.  In case of right angle information planes , this pattern is a circle. In a way,  a specific property of the particle took expression. This is by far not all the knowledge that particle may have. It is just a beginning. Particle now may give itself a name - a circle. In essence, it got an identity. 

 So now our lonely "point" got a description for "who am I". Now it can ask a valid question - Am I a circle ? Another thing to notice here , there is only one question for both the dimensions. This is a profound thing because we removed all the "No"s. What we achieved here is rather than recording raw information (as it is) from signals from two dimensions, we are asking a question about the manifestation. The answer remains "Yes" as long as the particle remains wiggling in two dimensions. If we remove the second dimension at any point, it again turns into information. If there is no particle wiggling at all then of course the answer is no. In a way, the manifestation confirms existence and it compacts information into a simpler format. That is what "Intelligence" is - making sense of information to express a property of inherent knowledge and at the same time compacting the information. Instead of "Yes"s and "No"s along the infinite length of each dimension, we have only one time line with a "Yes" or "No". 


It is important to state that the notion of "a dimension" is something that is not influenced from any other dimension or anything external. It has nothing to do with the width or the thickness - those measures come into play when we start viewing the world in three dimensions. Since no information is allowed from outside , the idea of spinning a second dimension , must come from with in the first dimension. This means - the idea of finding "who I am" is in-built into a dimension itself. Thus "Quest" is fundamental. "Who am I" is the first question. A new born child wants to know it. A new born cell too. So does a new born universe. The downside, however, is quest is endless. It never stops. 

At this point, you may feel that the circular shape as we discussed above is some sort of projection. Like something on our TV screen. Einstein proved quite the opposite. He showed that a two dimensional EM field actually manifests a physical particle. A photon - that can knock off an electron from the surface of a metal plate. These days , the idea of the "fields" is pretty common. The "Quantum Field Theory" provisions twenty three more such fields to our universe to describe all the elementary particles of standard model. The way EM field gives rise to a Photon , these fields manifest all the building blocks of our universe something akin to matter waves. A transformation of information to manifestation. 


Let's look at a single time line of two dimensional electro-magnetic field. "X" is the dimension of electric field, "Y" is the dimension of magnetic field and "Z" is the Time pointing towards past. 


<p align="center">

  <img src="./emf.gif">

</p>  



As long as the electromagnetic field exist, the history of timeline continues to be yes. Since EM field (like other fields of QFT) is universal that means Photons are everywhere. In particular when they hit an electron, the interaction changes their energy level. This disturbance passes through this field at the speed of light. That is how we see the objects because our eyes are a sensor for the photons.


### Knowledge to Manifestation

Information Fields of many spatial dimensions can co-exist in a single timeline. That means if you have two spatial dimensions , you don't need two more dimensions for time. As shown in the graphic above - the timeline captures "Yes" or "No" for the circle. In a multi-dimensional scenario , think a dimension as as a channel feeding information to timelines. When the timeline becomes unique for multiple dimensions, the knowledge is said to be decrypted and manifestation happened. Both of these are instantaneous. 

Intelligence can add as many dimensions as it deems necessary to manifest a shape. For example , in case of photon, the "point" needed only two dimensions. 

#### Automation
With in entire space, wherever the conditions are met, manifestation happens automatically. For example for a Photon , the only conditions needed are pre-existing electromagnetic field, thus Photons manifest automatically wherever an electromagnetic field exists. In essence automation is built in the knowledge. As long as there is an external intervention (action) is needed , knowledge is still incomplete - timeline is still not converged to a single yes or No - Triage for a better configuration of dimensions is still going on. 

We see this phenomenon all around us. When the conditions are met, the swamps are filled up with fish. Forests are filled up with trees. Insects show up. Most of the products that we humans make, are not fully automated. Thus the notion of manufacturing , supply chains and monetary systems. As we improve our knowledge , most of the basic things will be available to every one just like water and air. Now you may say trees are NOT available on Mars, you are absolutely right , because a critical dimension in case of trees are water and air . And the fertile crust of Earth. If such conditions are met on other planets - Trees and biological life will automatically spring up and who knows it might already be there. 

The obvious question is how water, air and solids like Earth showed up. The information for these are in "matter waves" and goes without saying , manifestation of solids needs third dimension. Thus "Inflationary Epoch" was creation of third dimension - i.e creation of space itself as we perceive it. The obvious thing is such knowledge needed very few preexisting conditions. Those conditions should be available even now. And that is right , even now space is being created and it is expanding our universe greater than the speed of light. That is the reason galaxies are drifting apart. Thus idea of limiting "Time" to speed of light is just a scale for our electromagnetic space. Time for every manifestation is its own information beat. Gita calls it `Kaal Chakra` - The cycle of time.

#### Complexity

Transformation of knowledge into manifestation and automatic spread of manifestations wherever required information exists is a simple cycle. It might appear gargantuous but it is scale invariate - means a "point" is similar to entire universe. A point has complete knowledge as much as the entire universe. Every manifestation in between, though has an entire copy of knowledge but only a certain part expresses itself through decryption of certain set of knowledge. Thus manifestations are complimentary. They are like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Thus they come together to form more complex expressions. Just like modules in a complex application. Together they give rise to our beautiful world. These complex manifestations - such as living beings - we humans, follow the same principle - single timeline. But they don't need to discover the timelines of constituents. As such entire universe has just one timeline. It exists or it doesn't. Yes or No. 

However this complexity gives rise to superior intelligence what we know as consciousness. A way to perceive the universe in it's beautiful glory. Ability to seek pleasure in being. But complexity is only an intermediate thing.

#### Garbage Collection

In such a complex intermediate or internal state , conditions may change such that requirements for existing manifestations are no more met. Thus the idea of garbage collection. Such perished manifestations breakdown into their primary constituents and are available to form parts of other manifestations that have the ability to thrive in changed conditions. Thus the cycle of birth and death with in universe. But such birth and death is NOT to be confused with the reverse cycle of "manifestation to Knowledge". It is just reshaping of manifestations. 

#### Infinity and Duality

1d information fields are infinite because there is no way to tell how much to wiggle. As such this state is pure information. Manifestation needs minimum two dimensions and thus the birth of Duality. All fundamental particles must have an anti particle. Duality expresses itself in different ways in complex manifestations.

#### Who am I

At the very core, manifestation is answer to the fundamental question - Who am I? Thus all the manifestations have identity. Thus identity is dualistic. 


### Cycle of Manifestation to Knowledge.

In our physical universe, Black Holes are probably the most fascinating objects. Theory of Relativity predicted black holes but Stephen Hawkings took our understanding of Black Holes to next level. The problem however is , unlike the regular manifestation or even the tiny sub atomic particles, Black Holes are beyond our observatories. We can only describe them through mathematics. And math of black holes is insanely complex. To put it intuitively, a Black hole is a place where information separates from the knowledge. The physical manifested objects are restored back into pre manifested state. The information spreads along the surface of the black hole (event horizon)  and knowledge acts like a singularity. The question "Who am I" doesn't make sense. The quest ends. The knowledge inside a Black Hole is self sustained. That is the reason it is also called a singularity.

Scientifically , our understanding of black holes is still primitive. Of the few things we know about Black Holes is one that is particularly intriguing. And that is Black Holes are incredibly cold places. The The new theories of Quantum Mechanics such as ADS-CFT predicts that our universe is a holographic projection of the information held at the surface of a Black Hole and we are all living inside a Black Hole. The math of ADS-CFT is impeccable to say the least. In a way , the entire universe is inside a singularity . It is our tiny point before it started wiggling. 

We may not be in position to understand the black holes but there are many things in our ordinary life, with increasing complexity , the context and the answer stop making sense. For example when I ask "Who am I" the single answer is my name. That is good to run the things. My signatures are good for the bank but my name doesn't really communicate who I am.  Even the things that we humans make reach a level of complexity where answer doesn't make any sense. For example if you ask someone what is it that she is talking on - the answer is a "smart phone". But what does the smart phone mean? The knowledge held in the tiny device is so complex that it is beyond our normal perception. At this stage, it appears that the knowledge is hidden or the answer is a mere abstraction of vastly complex set of knowledge. Abstractions need explanations. For example an electron or a Photon makes same sense to an alien as much as it makes to us but our car is beyond description to an alien. The context of the car is a machine used for transport by humans living on an obscure planet called earth that runs in a tiny solar system in the far flung regions of milky way. Understanding such a context is difficult for even us that's the reason we resort to abstractions. 

The question at this stage shifts from knowledge asking "who am I ?" to a manifested objects such as a human (or a car) asking  "who am I?" Who am I under this abstracted name? What is the nature of my knowledge ? A better question is "Why am I what I am?". Manifestation itself becomes a mystery. 

The good news is we are all in this state. We are all manifested beings of immense complexity. Every aspect of our identity is an abstraction of thousands of abstractions. Thus knowledge is invisible to us. 

The question is how do we access or feel or get a glimpse of our knowledge. The thing that created us is hidden to us. Now obvious extension of the question is why do we need to access this knowledge ? Why not let it be where it is ? The answer is - Not knowing is a legit choice. But it comes at a cost. Since we (and everything around us) is manifested out of a wave, the nature of our life is a wave - in that there are cycles of elation and pain. It is a never ending roller coaster. I don't know if we can experience a black hole or become one where we may be able to separate information from knowledge but thankfully Gita suggests a simpler approach - `Karm Yoga`. This is the path to see or feel our internal hidden knowledge in this manifested body. 

The first aspect of `Karm Yoga` is to understand that this cycle of knowledge to manifestation and vice versa is end less. There is no victory post. The journey never ends. In some shape or form it continues. In this universe or somewhere else in a parallel universe. There is no entry or exit. The notion of exit is exit from the cycles of elation and pain. In essence the goal is to ride the waves. We are NOT trying to solve the mysterious universe. Neither are we destined to create new ones. The idea is to feel the peace wherever we are. However, end of pain does mean end of happiness too. There is no silver bullet that may keep you ever joyous. The choice is entirely subjective. If you feel like trying this path, read on ..

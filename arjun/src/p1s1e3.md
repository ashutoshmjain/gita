- What exactly is Naad Yoga
- What is Art. A version of artist's truth. Closer to truth, better the artifact.
- What are dreams. Why do we lose them ?

### 3.4

Na [not] Karmnaam [of righteous action] Anarambhan [the ones that are never initiated] Naishkarmyam [a stage where one is beyond actions - such as Krishna] Purushah [a man] Ashnute [one who achived said stage];

{A man doesn't achieve the stage where she is beyond actions by the actions that are never started}

(In essence - you can only get freedom from actions by acting on some actions - the ones you didn't even start are not helping you accomplish this stage)

Na [nor] Cha [also] Sannyasnat [one who has renounced everything, towards them] eva [] Siddhim [distinguisable success] Sam-adhigacchti [easily goes towards].

{Nor distinguishable success goes towards the ones who have renounced everything}

(In essence - we all want to get to a stage where we can get everything we desire without doing anything - `Naishkarmya` - Some of us try to get there by pursuit of knowledge ie automation and others by renunciation ie "why have it" ; Krishna says that you can't get to this stage by not starting the action. Actions are mandatory requirement)

### 3.5

Na [nor] Hi [certainly] Kashchit [anyone] Kshnam [a moment] Api [too] Jatu [at any time] Tishthati [stays - sit down] Akaram Krit [doing nothing];

Karyate [do] Hi [certainly] Avashah [perforced] Karma [actions] Sarvah [All] Prakriti-Jaih [born of their nature] Gunaih[qualities]

{Its not like someone can sit idle. They are perforced into actions by their nature}

### 3.6

Karmemdrayani [Work Organs - Hands, feet] Sanyamya [holding back] Yah [who] Aaste [indulges in] Mansa [mind] Smaran [thinking];

Indriya Arthan [purpose of above work organs] Vumudha [oblivious] Atma [person] Mithya [fasle] Aacharah [conduct] Sa [he] Uchyate [showcases].

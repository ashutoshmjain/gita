Fairy was surprised to see a lunch invitation from her Brother. It read simple and straight - I am in the city on Wednesday. Lets grab some lunch together. Your place, my bill. She knew her brother too well to be surprised on the message. He thought the world must drop everything to attend to him!

"Your place, my bill" was a code that he was in deep shit. Something that he wouldn't take to the parents - his sister must bail him out. He was willing to eat lunch of her choice and also pay for it - a big accommodation from his standpoint.

She ordered a vegan salad with a white wine. Brother understood she didn't want to indulge - she wanted to keep it business - what are you up to?

He bit big into his equally big Burrito - I need one coin that I would return with in a month - max. To his credit - he had never messed up the money part. Whenever she bailed him out - he recouped the money with five and half percent interest, before time. The problem was "Fairy" was not too sure of his enterprise. He wanted to be the richest Wizard - the means were least of his concern as long as he adhered to the laws of the jurisdiction. Everyone in the family knew that law is always by intent. Finding loopholes is a right approach for the code that ran the machine but if you tried to find loopholes in the "code of conduct", you may find millions. You must aspire to follow the intent of the law - not other way around. And that there is only one reason to uphold the law - there are thousands to bend it. Brother didn't subscribe to the idea of "reason". To him winner wrote the history. He spoke slower than his normal pitch - you don't wanna know this sister - I don't want to rock your relationships ! - and that is exactly what he wanted to do. And that is what he already did by saying what he said. And why not - that little Angel of dirt was trying to sabotage his biggest investment after stealing one key to the trust - Fairy's heart.

Go on - I am listening - she knew her friends and she knew she could handle the waves of duality.

Don't say I didn't warn you ! And you can't bring it on me in the family - which meant you can't talk to no one.

Fairy rushed to vomit her salad - she couldn't digest the extent to which people go to make money. She did sign the invoice her brother sent from his business account. She held one key of the multiSig Trust - Brother had another and the last one was with Parents. They only needed two keys to clear the funds.

In normal circumstances, Fairy wouldn't listen to anyone talking about Angel's work. If anyone knew - good for them - her role was to NOT know. And neither was that she couldn't find if she wanted to - information travelled much faster in her world.

---

Angel could sense the tension in the air - what is the matter honey - am I bringing my work conflicts to home? Living a life of secrecy is hard. Your behaviour adapts to work. It shows up even if you don't say a word.

The question for Fairy was if she may brood on it or should she confront. She had thought of talking to Friend first but how would she even tell her that Angel was ready to risk their relationship for his career. How should she frame the idea that he was ready to load a beta AI model in his mind - without even asking her - a model that may leave him altered into a different person for ever. To analyse the "unintended consequences" - horse shit. She chose to confront.

Would you want to ask me if your work wanted you to go live on Mars for ever? - She asked. 

Angel couldn't look into her eyes. He knew he was living a lie but when must you tell your partner - what is that line - I am not going to Mars. It is just a small experiment.

A small thing wouldn't take six months extension - she was logical. The relationship between a man and a woman is a protocol - "logic" doesn't work here because they see the reality from two different places. No one is right or wrong. You must trust the protocol - that both are right and the path forward is based on the trust in the protocol.

She knows it - he thought - there is nothing to hide and it is not important "who told her" - yet he tried. 

`Bhagya` (abstract noun)  - The generally accepted meaning of this Sanskrit word is "fate". If we peel a layer, the meaning reduces to the way things unfold in (immediate) present — our sensory reality. 

Somewhat opposite of this word (in English) is "Destiny" — the long term outcomes. As an astrologer, `Maharishi Parashara` learnt early on —  one can predict the destiny, but it is impossible to predict the  "fate" — the nuances of our sensory reality. 

There are infinite possibilities, triggered by just five senses, when they experience the variations of our "real verse" — our tiny box. Our emotions, actions, feelings, pains and elations — all live in this moment. Modern Hindi poet `Ayodhya Singh Upadhyay 'Hariaudh'` describes the possibilities — `Bhagya` — in his famous poem `Ek Boond` — a droplet of rain. He says as a droplet leaves the clouds, she wonders what is in store for her?. Will I diminish in the dirt, or will I burn in some fire?


> Dev mere bhagy mein kya hai bada
>
> main bachungi ya milungi dhool mein?
>
> ya jalungi gir angaare par kisi?
>
> choo padungi ya kamal ke phool mein?
>
>---
> O deity of luck, what ills wait in my fate?
>
> will I live, or lay on dirt to rot?
>
> or fall, to burn on ember hot?
>
> or will I seep into an open lotus flower [^pearl] ?

It might appear that the fate pushes us in different direction — sets us up on newer unknown courses;  but overall sum of all that "push n pull", in the long term, evens out. Hence, the long term future is predictable. Thus astrology may predict only long term future. Present day nuances of our sensory reality are indeterminate. 

Think of our tiny box analogous to a  casino. We can't predict the result of one single hand. But we can assert the outcomes of say a thousand trials - with fair degree of accuracy. Same is true for stock market. We can't determine the movement of a single scrip in short term, but a long term investment in a broad index always bears the fruits.  A knowledgeable player, thus, is never swayed by the coincidental outcomes. Their focus is always on the righteous actions. On the other hand, most people are lost in the pains and elations of the current moment. They bet on outcome of a single throw of dice ! They are never tired of trying out their luck ..

This is not to say that above knowledge absolutely absolves us from the sorrows or happiness. It only blunts the edge of pain or happiness because sensory reality is powerful...

# `Bhagya`

`Dashraj` woke up late, well past noon, thanks to the extra liquor, he consumed last night. He was barely through his morning routine when he heard a loud knock on his door. Who at this time ? His friends knew he hated visitors till evening, and girls had their own keys. The good thing, if any, about `Dashraj` was he never cared to put controls on the girls. They could come and go as they wished as long as they made some money for him. 

As he opened the door, he saw a horseman, ironclad and holding a flag of `Kuru` kingdom. A neighbor had guided him to the address and knocked the door for him. The horseman stepped down and bowed in respect as he saw `Dashraj`. Taking the king's stamp out in his hand, he said — `Shrimat Dashraj` (a respectful address, slightly more than a plain  "Mr." which is equivalent to `Shri` in `Hindi or Sanskrit`), I am here under instructions from the king of all lands and rivers, the emperor of vast `Kuru` kingdom `Maharaaj Shantanu`. The king has asked for your presence for a private council. I may wait here till the time of your convenience to ride with me — he pointed to another empty horse that he had brought for `Dashraaj`. The carefully dangling sword, and the muscles on the horseman were enough to let `Dashraj` know that saying a "no" wasn't an option, not that `Dashraj` wanted to deny himself this opportunity to see the king. He was always keen to meet people of power though being called upon by the emperor was beyond his wildest dreams.

Oh sure, let me dress up suitably for the respect of the king — as he was about to turn back inside, fate played the trick, he saw `Satyawati` walking back in. She wasn't surprised to see the `Kuru` flag at her door step. She knew `Shantanu` had promised to speak personally with her father. Without looking at the horseman, she stepped inside the big home. `Dashraj` checked with the horseman, if he or his horse needed water or anything else, to which he got a clever answer — Not till the work of my lord is done !

I don't know why the king wants to see me. Did I say anything wrong yesterday?  — `Dashraj` casually spoke to `Satyawati` — But then why would he want a private council rather then having me sent to a court ! — this time, as if he was talking to himself.

A smile broke up on her face. She first thought to let `Dashraj` have a "surprise", but decided against it for she didn't want to give old man undue stress — He might ask for my hand in marriage ! It was he who gave all that Gold yesterday !  — She said. She had no clue `Dashraj` was the last man to wish her a happy matrimony. 

Selfish and evil mind, as he was, `Dashraj` saw it as if king was trying to take away his most prized possession — his cash cow! No rich man could throw few pieces of metal and take away his life insurance — He thought — How am I going stop this?

The idea of denying `Satyawati` a marriage proposal was not new to `Dashraj`. Only difference was `Satyawati` was always with him in all those previous episodes. Sometimes he said "No" because the suitor was too old, other times he did so on account of financial standing. He even denied one wealthy young man because he didn't have a horse. This time, however, was different. How do you say a "no" to the emperor. Sure he was ten years older but such an age difference won't count for a royal wedding. But why am I thinking all these ? Maybe king wants to have `Satyawati` as a keep. It wasn't uncommon for rich to have women in different places out of wedlock. In that event she could stay here with me. She could continue to earn from the boat while king might pay her for every visit.  — `Dashraj` thought many nefarious schemes on his way to the kingly camp. More he thought, more he saw the plan forming in his mind. Smile returned back to his face. He knew how to navigate this challenge. If the king really wanted to get `Satyawati` as a keep, it was a yes in his mind — a win win situation. If the king wanted to take her with him, then he must ask for a proper wedding. And if king agreed, then he must ask something that king won't ever give and yet never hurt him. 

And first of all, he must seek a pardon for his life!

---

On his way, he saw a royal caravan. `Kansa`, was returning after his morning session that `Shantanu` had requested. The request did come as a surprise to `Kansa`  but when he reviewed the message, he smiled at his good fortune. King had proposed to buy the haunted island though the island was as much in the kingdom as in `Kansa's` territory, for the rivers were always  "no man's land". An offer to buy a piece of land while `Shantanu` could easily take the island with force, appeared to be a friendly gesture in `Kansa's` mind.

King had asked for a fair price for a piece of land that literally had no value. He thought king probably didn't know the place was haunted. Whichever be the case, it was good for him for it offered him an interaction with the king and probably an obligation too. `Kansa` knew obligations worked. If he did one favor, he could count on a favor back. In addition, he wanted no conflict with the heart-land till his own problems at home were resolved — the biggest of which was `Vasudeva` who he must keep alive till he killed the eighth son of `Devki` . `Kansa's` pleasure had no bounds when the king offered one thousand gold coins for the island. This kind of money, he could use to build his army that he had use to reach farther East (and South) to tax more peasants. 

As `Dashraj` saw `Kansa's` long caravan pass by, the truth dawned upon him. He understood the power of the emperor. He must keep his nerve. He must keep quiet. And he must play as if `Satyawati` was his true daughter. King would never harm a father acting to safe-guard the interests of his daughter.


---

`Dashraj` bowed to the king for the longest time. He straightened up after many requests (from the king) and then sat on the ground right near `Shantanu's` legs. A perfect display of humility. King stood up.  With his hands, he lifted `Dashraj`, and showed him a seat. He ordered the best wine for he knew `Dashraj` loved to indulge. `Dashraj` was already feeling thirsty for his mind had over-clocked since afternoon, when the horseman showed up at his door.

Coming straight to the point , King laid out his proposal — I want to marry your daughter `Satyawati`. 

King had thought an easy "yes" followed with the best wine would be a perfect conclusion of this action packed day. He had already sent a messenger to `Maharishi` about the closure of island deal with `Kansa`. After a long time, he was eagerly looking forward to a real celebration. Maybe a reentry into life !

`Aho Bhagya` (great luck) to `Satyawati`..... `Maharaj` but .. — `Dashraj` played his silence card..

`Shrimat Dashraj` you appear to have something on your mind, say it freely — King asked a bit confused! He had hoped that `Dashraj` would be joyous.

`Maharaj` you probably know worries of a daughter's dad, but how do I say it without a "pardon" on my life — `Dashraj` again went silent.

You have nothing to fear `Shrimat` — said the king, wondering even more as to what was there on `Dashraj's` mind — say it without any fear. Gods know, you have my word !

`Dashraj` tactfully hid his smile. He knew he got the king trapped — `Maharaj` if you insist, as a father of the daughter, I wish that the son from your union with `Satywati` be named your sole heir.

King felt a wave of anger that he thought he had forgotten long back. He stood up , his face red and body shaking. How can a lowly `Asura` make such a demand off the emperor. Do I really need his permission to marry a willing girl ? 

As the moment passed, he controlled his exasperation — `Dashraj`, you probably know, I have already named the heir. `Ganga Putra Dev` is going to be the king after me. You also know, in my lineage, such a decision can't be changed. I can do anything else for you if you want, but this ask is beyond me.

`Dashraj` kept silent. His eyes dug into the ground - `Maharaj`, I said so because you pardoned my life, and you insisted on the truth. You have all the powers. You can do whatever you like ! — His hands folded but he knew he aced this "act". If `Satyawati` stayed, his life was without any worries of worth or money, if the king agreed to change the heir, it had be the longest shot any one could dream from not only his village, but entire `Mathura`. People would know him as a "king maker", and he would have his place restored v/s oppressive `Maharishi Parashara`. His position among the `Asura` lords would be supreme, and his grand son would do to `Kuru` Kingdom what `Kansa` was doing to `Mathura` — a rise and revenge of his entire class !

There was nothing more to argue. Noting more to convince. King understood he was trapped in his own desires. A hole left after `Ganga` , that he wanted to fill up with life again, got even deeper. He felt ashamed that he permitted himself to fall. May be `Bhagya` has more tests for him. May be his life is meant to go loveless, and now meaningless too, for nothing will smell the same after `Satywati`. Nothing will taste and feel joyous. He wanted to run away. He let the despair out in a loud note to all his men — pack up, we will leave right now without waiting for the dawn.

He didn't know where he was headed ...


### Research and Notes

[^pearl]: Since a lotus flower stays up above dirt and water, a droplet may retain it's own if it was held in a silky lotus flower. A good outcome from droplet's standpoint.

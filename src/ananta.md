# `Ananta` - an infinite expanse

To appreciate the infinite expanse, we may describe `Hari` as some sort of omni-present field. His incarnations are mere representation of a deeper underlying substrate that is beyond our senses — a concious field maybe, one that exists and baffles scientific thinkers as much as followers of scriptures. 

The idea of a universal field, is not new. In mid 1800s , Michael Faraday, a brilliant experimental scientist and the seat of knowledge at Cambridge, who ultimately invented the electric motor, was intrigued by magnets. The question he had was simple — one that probably challenges every young mind — why do magnets repel when similar poles are brought near each other. Unlike most of us, he wondered if it is something to do with the inherent nature of magnets or if it is something extraneous! Is there something invisible between the magnets?  And unlike most of us, he concluded that between the two magnets, there exists a magnetic field such that it pulls opposite poles towards each other while it repels similar poles. And here is the kicker — the field exert pretty much the same force (on the magnets) even if magnets are taken into a Vacuum Chamber (or the space where there is no air - absolute nothing — no medium). 

 The idea of an omni-present field was actually older than Faraday. The Michelson-Morley experiment, conducted in 1887 by Albert Michelson and Edward Morley, was an attempt to detect the motion of the Earth relative to the supposed "aether" that was thought to pervade all of space. At the time, it was believed that light waves propagated through a stationary aether medium, just as sound waves travel through air.

The experiment was designed to detect the relative motion of the Earth through the aether by measuring the speed of light in different directions. Michelson and Morley used a device called an interferometer, which splits a beam of light and sends the two halves in different directions. The reflected beams are recombined to produce an interference pattern. The idea was that if the Earth was moving through the aether, then the speed of light in one direction should be greater than the speed of light in a perpendicular direction.

However, the experiment produced a null result, meaning that no difference in the speed of light was detected in any direction. This was a surprising result that was difficult to explain within the context of the aether theory. The lack of an observed aether wind suggested that the Earth was not moving through any stationary medium, which contradicted the prevailing idea of the time.

The Michelson-Morley experiment did not prove the existence of aether, but rather it provided evidence against the idea that aether existed. The experiment's null result was one of the factors that ultimately led to the rejection of the aether theory and the development of the theory of relativity, which proposed that the speed of light is constant and does not depend on the motion of the observer or any hypothetical medium.

Einstein understood well as to why the speed of light was constant in all directions, and he made it the core underlying assumption of the most revolutionary theory of our time — theory of special relativity. The idea is so simple that it defied the general intelligence — that the "Time" is nothing but speed of light. If light traveled faster than the duration of "one second" will automatically reduce such that speed always fell back to fixed value of ~ 300000 km /sec

> 1 light second = say 300000 Km
>
> Speed of light =  distance /time = light second /  second = light
>
> --> speed of light is time independent

This revolutionary thinking, while led to numerous true finding about our physical world, true being what is same for all observers, but it hid beneath it the biggest truth that the field in itself is beyond observation. We can only speculate about it through mathematics for specific explanations.  Or the real truth is held in the field. Just the way water in a pond is more fundamental than the waves that emerge at a drop of stone, the Photons (or light)  manifest due to disturbance in this underlying field. Maxwell described this field mathematically by bringing the work of Gauss and Faraday together in the shape of consistent framework. With a hindsight of almost 150 years, we know Maxwell work was one of the most important piece in contemporary physics yet it was not an immediate success. Professor Freeman J. Dyson wrote in one of his famous [essays](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/em/dyson.pdf)

> The notion of a field was hard to grasp because fields are intangible. The scientists of that time, including Maxwell himself, tried to picture fields as mechanical structures composed of a multitude of little wheels and vortices extending throughout space. These structures were supposed to carry the mechanical stresses that electric and magnetic fields transmitted between electric charges and currents.

We now understand how this field works,  much better,  and how to use electromagnetic force for our daily use, but even now, we can't perceive the field in all it's entirety. We aptly use mathematics to explain certain emergent features that we observe, for example the attraction (or repulsion) between magnets, flow of electricity or say speed of light, but underlying field may do whole lot more that we have no clue of. And, of course, we have no clue whatsoever as to how this field came into being.

I have no intent to claim electro-magnetic field is God or God's creation, but imagining something that extends across our entire universe, yet invisible to our eyes and beyond our touch, in itself is a feature of a believer. But wait - we are not done yet. Science is pretty conclusive that we have at least sixteen  such underlying fields that give rise to all the elementary particles. 


Unfortunately, the physics taught in high schools , at least when I attended in the 80s, was at least hundred years behind the curve. Richard Feynman, had already figured out elegant solutions to the "workings" of electro-magnetic fields (quantum electrodynamics). The physicists had moved their focus to the underlying field rather than the emergent particles but our focus (in high school)  was still on the "atom" and their constituents - protons, neutrons and electrons, as discrete particles that existed, we were told,  without any reason whatsoever. The world seemed to have found the very basic building blocks which was intriguing and exciting for a high schooler. The sad part is , in the guise of this incomplete particle physics, we only slightly brushed the ideas of Maxwell. The electromagnetic field, I thought, had something to do with electricity, which sure ran the TV (we had recently bought)  but it ain't as big a deal as the atom and the atom bomb. How wrong could our curricula be! 

If I were to design the high school physics course for me today in 2023, I would probably leave myself at the definition of a classical field (The electromagnetic field of Maxwell and Einstein). And tell my younger self that it is around 150 years old concept, but this is the one on which they would build the very latest, may be in a university course, but I wouldn't confuse myself with truck load of obsolete thinking. These hundred fifty years are important from the historical perspective in building a quantum definition of our world from contributions of the most brilliant science thinkers such as Planck, Maxwell, Einstein, De Brogli, Bohr, Schrodinger, Dirac , Feynman and many more; but they are important for those who want to indulge in the discovery path of quantum mechanics ; certainly not me as a high schooler. 

For example,  I wouldn't indulge in the ideas of basic building blocks, such as electrons or protons. Not even quarks or the leptons. Because what we now know for sure, is the fact, that basic building blocks have no meaning without underlying respective fields. The science, particularly physics, meets scripture at this most basic level — the quantum fields. In our reductive approach to this fascinating  world, we may continue to go atomic to the realm of electrons and protons but we can't stop there. We have more basic subatomic particles in quarks , leptons and bosons. And these particles are only incarnations of their infinite underlying fields - quantum fields to be precise.

You may argue that I am betting too much on the "Quantum Field Theory" and particularly the "standard model". And you are right because, it is one model that explains our world better than anything else. Better because most of its findings are testable. For the uninitiated ones, or those who read obsolete physics of 80's high schools, here is a quick run-down. Standard model of Quantum Field's Theory, defines twelve particles that make our world. They include three types of quarks (up/down , charm /strange, top and bottom) and three types of Leptons (electron / electron neutrino, Muon / Muon Neutrino, and Tau / Tau Neutrino). These twelve sub atomic particles (along with their anti-particles) rise from their respective quantum fields. In addition to these substance like particles and their underlying fields, there are four more particles to bind the twelve substantive particles together. These are called Bosons. Bosons give rise to the three basic forces - electro-magnetic force (photons), W and Z bosons for week force and eight types of gluons for the strong force. And finally the Higgs boson gives all the substance and force particles their tiny masses. 

So put together, we have sixteen quantum fields. Some of them interact with each other while others are quite inert. These sixteen fields make up our beautiful universe. There are however few problems. The least of which is this model can't fully describe gravity, the fourth force. But it is not for lack of imagination — it is because the mathematics of QFT (quantum field theory) is prohibitive, to say the least. Or we may say that we still need to discover the math. The biggest problem however is - how do we understand the origin or behaviour of the underlying sixteen fields ( though these days number of such basic fields go up to 256 based on who you are talking to) .

The verse (`Chaupai`) stayed with me for many weeks, ringing in my mind and sometimes on my lips. On the surface, I knew `Hari` is synonym for Lord `Vishnu` — the God of all creations, and poet metaphorically praised the lord for his infinite expanse, but what if the poet actually meant what he wrote — a mathematical infinity — something truly beyond our perception. Then how do we know who is `Hari` and why must his narratives endless ! Like the group of blinds groping an elephant, are we trying to solve the puzzle from individual vantage ?

The [Sanskritdictionary.com](https://sanskritdictionary.com) was few clicks away ..

> <sup> Hari (हरि ) [Definition](https://sanskritdictionary.com/hari/279877/1) : m. (especially) Name of viṣṇu-kṛṣṇa- (in this sense thought by some to be derived from hṛ-,"to take away or remove evil or sin")  etc. </sup>

The definition, led me to a deeper dwelling...

`Hari` means the one who removes darkness, and obstacles. `Hari` may act as divinity — a discrete person — or another finite form of manifestation such as an animal, or a tool or a machine — or simply in a probabilistic fashion — a chance. In `Rig Veda`,`Hari` is considered the first of all divine forces —  a synonym for `Vishnu`. 

Being able to find a good definition and extend it with my own rationale, helped my quest for few days, but the question remained — why existence of such a force? If there exist a force for good, then there must be a force for evil too. And who gets to decide what is good and what is evil? Is it only for humans ? What about animals ? Even more, what about non living - the basic building blocks of life such as proteins or sub atomic particles? Do they have any sense of good v/s bad !

As the poet said, `Hari` has infinite narratives. One such, that interested me more (than others) and, presented a very different  perspective is from `Sirla Bhaktivinoda`. This point of view harmonizes religious insights with the scientific approach, and it kinda puts an end to the "good v/s evil" debate.  He premised `Vishnu` in an evolutionary force.`Vishnu`, through his incarnations , takes consciousness to ever higher levels. In essence, it is not `Vishnu` that decides good v/s bad - the force delegates the decision to rising consciousness. From `Matsyavtara` (fish) to `Krsna`, `Vishnu's` incarnations kick-start a progression in consciousness. In essence, "Good v/s bad" is a decision of future. At our current state of evolution, we are probably not fully equipped to take this call.

Having resolved the "good v/s evil" debate, my mind got transfixed onto evolution. The ten incarnations of `Hari`, described as "full incarnations" above, are thus, major evolutionary milestones. Scriptures and culture is full of their narratives. That, however, is not all, there are countless other narratives representing minor milestones in our journey to a civilized way of life. These minor milestones are called "perfections" of `Vishnu` — `Vibhooties`. 

The key thing is these "perfections" are NOT limited to human form — they are the "state of art" — books, horses, elephants, weapons, games, biological processes. Even perfections in gambling are `Vibhooties` of `Krsna`. And by that extension, they could be in computing, robotics, space travel, genomics and every other pursuit of excellence.

When asked by `Arjuna` to describe himself, in chapter ten of `Bhagvad Gita`, `Krsna` expressed himself through his `Vibhooties` — I am the "force of creation" in all such endeavours that are demonstrable as my "perfections". 

He said ..

Thus the "stories" of `Hari` (`Hari Katha`) are the stories of creative accomplishments. From manifestation of a coherent book by a solo writer, to millions of us working together to write Wikipedia —  they signify the upwards trajectory of cognition. Be it the primordial force that instantiated our universe, or the tiny innovations within our realm — from the "wheel" to our  first car(t), or the first flight in open skies,  or the fist light bulb. Or the operating systems, the internet , or the virtual worlds — anything that takes us to higher orbit of consciousness . These stories are endless, because such manifestations are infinite. 

It doesn't really matter if the story is put in factual format with unassuming experimental data as in scientific papers, or it is a flight of fancy with dragons or zombies; as long as the narrative targets active upwards progression, it is self consuming and self sustaining. And telling such stories is inspiring as much as listening to them.

-----

Once I understood, what `Hari` stands for, it was easy to comprehend that his stories are endless. Our senses are designed to perceive the manifested excellence — be it an incarnation or a breakthrough idea. We are good at telling stories of the things that we could see, touch or feel :-)  But how do we map our heads to the idea of underlying infinite perpetual force — `Hari Ananta`? Is it even possible to imagine `Hari` in our limited sensory reality? 

To clarify my claim above , understanding  "what `Hari` stands for" , didn't mean I know `Hari`! I only understood that `Hari` is something that progressively takes our consciousness to higher levels. I have no clue what it is and how it does such an immense task. For example just because I know it is the code that runs my desktop ; doesn't mean I know coding! 

Knowing `Hari`, however,  is a chase that we must undertake for the exercise is NOT worthless. In fact, it is the most rewarding quest even though we know that the object of our quest is beyond our sensory perception — definitely beyond our reductive minds. Why ? — you may ask. And the answer is simple — knowing `Hari` is knowing "who we are"! Because, we are, after all, a superior emergence of consciousness. And the amazing thing is, as we progress in this quest, the "perfections" reveal themselves. The idea is equally applicable whether we take a spiritual or a scientific route to this discovery. They both lead to the same conclusions and the path for each is pretty similar. Gita calls this path "Karm Yoga".

As a first step, `Hari` is obviously not one unique person. One that may incarnate in millions of ways, is obviously not ONE  perceivable God. Narratives may over-glorify the persona, but the intent is always on the fundamental aspect of nature. The underlying force that removes illusions is `Hari`. It is the force that separates 'unreal' from 'real', from "random unformed" to "perfectly organized". Even `Krsna` told `Arjuna` to focus on this underlying force. He said

> Or rather, what hast thou to do, by knowing all this in detail (about my perfections), O Arjuna? Supporting this entire universe with only a portion (of myself), I stand.[246]"

So my quest now boiled down to a simple question — finding something "infinite" ( `Hari Ananta`)  and something that holds my entire universe with a portion of its strength (`Gita`). That is quite an ask ! What could that be ! 

Turned out my quest is no different from the deepest scientific minds. From Dirac to Feynman, From Einstein to Hawking — all of them were searching the same underlying truth — theory of everything. `Bhagvad Gita` puts this idea very elegantly. It says — knowing me is the knowledge, knowing the ways I (this knowledge) work is science.

Let's take the later first - How this knowledge works !

---

----

The fundamental question for physicist of our ages is —  Why does electro-magnetic field exist? — at every single point in space though we could never directly feel it. Not only one EMF , every point in space has at least fifteen more fields. Are these fields real or they exist in our currently broken mathematics. After all, fields are used only to compute the particle existence - its velocity or the spin. We might push the question of more exotic manifestations such as Protons, Neutrons under the rug as they are simply templates to combine subatomic particles. And so are even more exotic templates that make proteins out of atoms that finally lead to a conscious being such as your dog or me your friend. However, if we examine each of the fields, we come across three basic characteristics:

- First that every field knows how to manifest its particle.
- Second that the knowledge to manifest is held with in the particles of the field or particles of the field with which it interacts.
- The field knows how to NOT manifest imperfect particles - from imperfect I mean particles of smaller size than the basic building blocks.

In essence, all the basic fields have manifestative property, they bear knowledge and they regulate themselves. In `Vaidik` parlance, we define these three properties are `Vishnu`, `Bramh` and `Siva`. If we see all the eternal fields through `Vaidik` lens, then we may not even be required to indulge in sixteen or more fields. There is just one eternal field that is infinite and it creates our beautiful universe with only a part of it's decrypted knowledge and of course regulates it to remove the infinities and irregularities. Just like sub atomic particles, every creation is a specific template that has already been decrypted. The manifestations of these templates are used in evolutionary manner to build more exotic templates.

`Vishnu` is the manifestative potency that uses "intelligence" to decrypt `Brmha` - the underlying knowledge base. It is the accumulation of certain quantum of knowledge ( with rigor) that suddenly  precipitates into success perceivable by our senses. The beauty of the framework is that the `Bramh` rises out of `Vishnu` for the knowledge is held in infinite relationships between manifested things. From human to human, from a tree to another, and between non-living to living and between subatomic particles. The infinite network of connections between everything to every other thing is `Bramha`, for knowledge is held in the synapses (parameters) of this vast ginormous  network. `Vishnu` is the cause of `Bramha` and `Bramha` incarnates `Vishnu`, for ever higher conscious progression, finally leading to a state of absolute knowledge - `Siva`. This super refined knowledge `Siva` is what maintains the continuum. It curates the omnipresent expanse of the underlying field, curtails it and cares for it.

----

In essence, this genre of story telling, where intelligent endeavour meets the divine grace of knowledge, to create the next big thing or a tiny improvement - next big shift or a better way to do what we been doing for centuries,  is auspicious. In `Vaidik` traditions, `Vishnu` is invoked to start any significant undertaking. The mantra from `Garuda Purana` is generally used to invoke `Vishnu` ..

It is in this spirit, with hands folded, and being aware of the infinite expanse of her creations, I present my humble submission `Mathura` - a historical narrative that investigates the time, and situations when humanity first discovered the "written word" as a medium to preserve knowledge. But more importantly, it understood what the knowledge is ...

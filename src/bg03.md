# Karmyoga

As  name signifies the chapter's primary focus on the path of selfless action. It emphasizes the importance of performing one's duties without attachment to the results. Krishna explains to Arjuna that inaction is impossible for embodied beings and that even maintaining one's physical existence requires action. Therefore, the chapter guides on how to engage in actions in a way that leads to spiritual growth and liberation, rather than bondage to the material world. This is achieved by dedicating all actions to the divine and relinquishing the desire for personal gain or reward.

This excerpt from "Karma-yoga: Duty and Self-Realization" presents a poetic dialogue between Arjuna and Lord Kṛṣṇa, focusing on the path of selfless action. Arjuna is confused about whether wisdom or action is superior, and Kṛṣṇa clarifies that both wisdom and selfless service are paths to self-realization, emphasizing that performing one's prescribed duty without attachment to results (karma-yoga) is crucial. The text explains that actions done as a sacrifice for a higher purpose free one from karmic bondage, while selfish actions lead to further entanglement. Ultimately, the chapter stresses the importance of controlling the senses and mind to overcome the destructive force of lust, which obscures true knowledge and hinders spiritual progress, advocating for acting according to one's dharma with detachment and devotion.

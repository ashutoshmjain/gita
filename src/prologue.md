# Upashama

Krishna Dvaipayana was brought to life for a purpose. He was destined to compile thousands of real, practical and sacred insights — new and old, from ancient cave dwellers to super saints (`Maharishis`); and rearrange the text into four foundational volumes — `Vedas` — four books of most ancient wisdom known. This, in itself, was noble enough to dedicate a life-time, but his real goal was lot bigger. Immensity of his purpose, rightly made him one of the 'immortal eights' in Hindu tradition.

We shall need to uncover a bit of ancient history, to be able to appreciate the task at his hand ...

Before his time, scriptures were probably passed on as `Shruti`-The spoken word. A team of authorized audio compilers (`Vyasas`) chanted the `mantras` whole day — right from the early morning to the late evening. Certain `Mantras` must be recited at a specific time of the day, at a specific place and in a specific tone. Some of them must be performed in front of holy fire — rites. Rites were performed in a prescribed fashion to invoke natural powers of five elements — a ritual known as `Dravya Yazna`. Intonations and pronunciation in carefully perfected ensemble, to pass on the divine knowledge to the next generation. The craft of chanting `mantras` with an ascetic lifestyle purposed for a singular focus on strict daily routine (`Bramhacharya`) and elocution, was called `Naad Yoga`. The literal meaning of word `Naad` is a dense voluminous sound that proves something — something akin to a roar of a lion in a vast silent jungle. It proves the lien of the lion. `Vyasas` were essentially `Naad Yogies`. They were trained to hold life energy in heart and throat `Chakras` — a proof of being human and being distinct from rest of the species. There was no generally cherished art of 'writing'.

Some `Vyasas` did consider the idea of converting the chants into text format for obvious advantages of durability and portability. What if all the `Vyasas` died? What if human race met its demise though epidemic or acts of nature? The ancient wisdom must be preserved beyond human shelf life. Those questions existed, but without the comfort of a Mac, writing itself was a herculean task! There were some parts written down on leaves (and preserved with herbal coatings) but that was mostly experimental work — half-baked, grammatically obsolete and contextually incoherent. The focus was not on the content. It was on the 'writing apparatus' and to test the claims of writing advocates. The advocacy on the pro-text side was the dream of freedom and promise of information being accessible to all. Something like the promise of internet — free access to information. Everyone should be allowed to invoke the five elements — control their life energies. Sounds like the promise of crypto-currencies and the decentralized finance!

Majority of the `Vyasas` didn't believe written word could ever replace the rigor and authenticity of chanting. Though writing meant lot more content could be scribed, and passed on to far-flung places; but the act of writing (and reading) wouldn't invoke any elemental powers — they thought! Somehow, the ritual had gotten more important than the content. On top, writing had no payback whereas chanting meant they could perform the rites for the kings and the rich, in lieu of necessities and niceties. Writing, on the other hand, had no such incentive. There was no kindle book store, no way to barter the text. It did have a promise to democratize the information and that did appeal to some, but such people were few and far. Most felt a commoner had no reason to access the `Vaidik` knowledge without a gate keeper. And most thought the job of a `Vyasa` was eternal — fully protected till the end of humanity. Just like we thought newspaper was for ever!

While the chanters were busy performing phony tricks, the writers camp was innovating at rapid pace. A new grammar for `Sanskrit` — the ancient language for `Vaidik` communication, was recently developed. *Panini* — a grammarian par excellence, wrote the new rules in his block buster book `Ashtadhyayi — eight chapters`. Panini's `Sanskrit` was to the ritualistic spoken words what `C lang` was to silos of computing before Unix arrived at the scene.  There was a sudden rush for writers. All the super saints wanted to use `Panini's` techniques to document their knowledge. Availability of text soon became the prerequisite for sustaining ever larger number of students. `Ashrams` — the saintly abodes, soon got turned into `Gurukuls` — the boarding schools where students stayed with the teachers for advanced education. The first course, of course, was Panini's Sanskrit. It was like html for the aspiring web designers. Centuries later, Paul Kiparsky wrote about `Ashtadhyayi` ...

> Modern linguistics acknowledges it as the most complete generative grammar of any language yet written, and continues to adopt technical ideas from it — 1994.

Back to our story — this was the first time someone was serious about organizing the world's knowledge. `Maharishi Parashra` wanted to capture the true knowledge into text and make it available to everyone. 'Organize' didn't mean dumping massive data loads into one big Hadoop cluster. They obviously didn't have GPT3! Instead, they figured out many organic faculties of knowledge — well-being and longevity (`Aayurveda`); economics (`Arth Shastra`); linguistics (`Vyakarna`); arithmetic (`Ganit`); to name a few. Organic, because these sciences were closely linked to music, literature and expressive art forms (`Sangeet, Sahitya and Kala`). There was no distinct separation between science and the arts. Instead of crunching bits and bytes (google way), they first invested in the pursuit of consciousness, and deep appreciation of physical reality. This knowledge enabled them understand the nature of time — Astrology (`Jyotish`). An astrologer was sure someone who could foretell the future, but astrology is inherently a deep understanding of space and time. Effect of motion of massive bodies in space and time on our physical reality. Armed with this ultimate spiritual science, instead of crisper-ing the genes, they figured how to predict the celestial conditions that might blossom the expression of a specific gene pool — with high degree of accuracy. A modern name for such a skill might be 'Organic Bio Intelligence harvesting'! That is quite mouthful :-)

This skill was like controlling the 'dice' itself, but it also meant long wait for the appropriate planetary alignment — sometimes, many generations in the future. Krishna Dvaipayana was one such awaited intelligent being. His birth was planned and predicated by *Maharishi Parashara*. And he was set up as an immortal agent — the knowledge that he had uncover would be added to every human core. How ? We shall see down the line...

Before this time, the human consciousness had two primary dimensions — it was led by 'duality' — wrong or right; true or false. With the advent of spoken word — ability to communicate verbally — humans learnt to debate and then everything got mixed up. A situation could be justified through many conflicting explanations — the core characteristic of the third epoch — Dualistic age (`Dwapara Yuga`). At the same time, 'plurality of views' was the primary differentiator from other species. Most animals did (and even now do) what they felt like doing — a unique response to a unique situation — no conflicts — no debate. Long after humans got this two-dimensional world-view, they still struggled to determine the path that reached them to eternal peace. Every aspect of 'duality' was confusing and was adding more of it. Many times, animals appeared happier. Some people prayed deities as a representation of 'one truth' and equal number revolted against the idea of 'One' God, because 'duality' was built into the psyche of humans. Many wanted to build their own world order — their own individual fork to the `Vaidik` 'way of life'. Such people were termed `Asuras`. The world was split between darkness and light. They were able to see both sides of the coin but none could tell if heads were right or the tails. Both seemed right and wrong at the same time. The answer was in the context — the frame of reference. And that is what was missing. Human mind was not ready to understand the core principles — the relativistic nature of thought, and the deterministic nature of `Karma`.

> This new vantage of duality led to rise of 'faith' that later got morphed into communities of religion — a proclaimed righteous path with its leader and his cult. There were groups who grew their head and facial hair such that they could cover entire body. Being able to cover entire body with hair was hailed as the ultimate purpose of life. Another faction who though animals were better than humans, started living like dogs — `Kukkurvritik`. They walked on four legs and ate like dogs. You could slice a 'reality' into as many views as you wanted and each with its own merits. Anyone with a gift of gab, could fork the public imagination. The very meaning of 'righteous' was lost on the masses. A new set of basic terms must be embedded into every instance of conscious thinking, every social contract — be it an individual, a group or even a kingdom — every single format of human organization. Time was ripe for a new narrative but who would do that? How could someone understand all that is there to know, and then conceive the righteous path. Not only that, the path must be told as a compelling story that takes the collective consciousness onto a new charter. And the story must be tested in physical reality before it is told. Because truth is what actually happens in physical reality and only truth has the staying power! 

Those were the challenges for `Maharishi Parashara` and he wondered if one lifetime was enough to accomplish this massive global change! Or he needed someone to carry on his journey to the finish line — may be a son who was also a disciple. What better can a 'man with a mission' ask? — a son who could take on the work he started.

`Maharishi Parashara` was an astrologer extraordinaire with proven `Yogic capabilities` — abilities to interact (bend) the elements. Right from his conception, he recited parts of Vedas. As he grew up, he developed innate aversion for the evil. He used his capabilities to wage a long war against the evil. He hated the sacrifice of animals in holy fire. So much so, he burnt many `Asuras` alive. He tried to conquer hate with more hate. But he finally realized that in this new age of duality, it was hard to decipher good from evil. `Asuras` were not inherently evil. It was their conditioning and experiences that made them what they were. The simple rules that depicted clarity of good verses evil, a hero verses a villain in the last epoch — `Treta Yuga` (an epoch characterized by rise of three basic qualities of consciousness), weren't good enough in this new paradigm. The plurality of ideas was a reality. Question that haunted him was how to create a new narrative that could help people ascertain the right path among many possible look-alike choices. A path baked in reality. He wanted to define the rules of engagement for that new world.

He however had no illusions. He knew deciphering the duality, might take more than a lifetime. He must pass on his learning to his son. If his son could find the truth, then that truth must be embedded into every conscious unit for simply killing the evil was not a solution. After years of careful study of motion of heavenly bodies and their co-relation with birth of human intelligence, stars were finally aligned. `Maharishi Parashara` was ready to take a child as his born son. And he named him even before the birth — Krishna. `Krishna Dvaipayana` — Someone who could go beyond duality.

And he had his eyes set on `Matsyagandha` as perfect mother to bear this divine child.

`Matsyagandha` was daughter of a fisherman who passed away when she turned eleven. Her mother had died in labor of her birth. No one wanted to be with her for she was labeled bad omen. Poor girl knew only one way to live in this world — ferry people across `Yamuna` — a mighty river, by the abode — `Ashrama` of `Maharishi Parashara`. Her only possession was her father's dilapidated boat. The atrocity of her fate was no one wanted to ride with her. Not only the boat was in bad shape, she herself had a pungent smell; thus the name `Matsyagandha` that literally meant someone who smelled like fish. No one had ever told the poor girl how to make up or present herself. Absolutely no training in hospitality. She used to get 'stuck and stranded' commuters when no other boat was around, normally early mornings or late evenings. And she hated it for she was scared of the waves in `Yamuna` in windy mornings as much as in the darkness of nights. Many times she thought of leaving her fate to the waves of `Yamuna`. No one in the village talked to her. She had no friends. No one would care to notice if she was lost from the face of Earth. The solitude of lone purposeless life made `Matsyagandha` spend time with herself and her imagination. Back at her broken hut, she used to gaze the stars through the holes in her thatched roof. She had no formal education, yet, she honed curiosity of a writer and creativity of a poet.

`Maharishi Parashara` had taken her boat once when he wanted to spend a dark night on the island middle of mighty `Yamuna`. A cursed jungle where no man wanted to go. Fishermen wanted their boats at least a mile from the ghost-land. Only `Matsyagandha` would take `Maharishi` to the island for she had no passenger in days. `Maharishi` was impressed with her courage. Little did he know the reason - she was short on basic supplies such as food and milk. And she herself was curious of the island. Many times she had thought of checking the place out, to see the demons. What worse could they be then her own fate?

`Maharishi's` presence had a soothing effect. She felt strong from him being around. At the same time as if no one was watching her. No one bothered by the state of her boat and even less of the bad smell that she was so conscious of. `Maharishi` was in deep thought, his eyes gazing the stars and then the shadows of the island. `Yamuna` was unusually calm this night. On the way, she mustered courage to ask `Maharishi` the meaning of her curse. She challenged the existence of 'One God' for God can't be so merciless. No one had ever put forth such a simple argument with such a child like naivety. Her deduction forced a `Yogi` to engage in conversation — an anomaly because `Maharishi Parashara` rarely spoke. Even the kings had to wait to hear his blessings. He never performed rites for money or favors nor did he engage in religious debates. He was a silent seeker lost in himself.

Her naive question and the pain in her eyes forced `Maharishi` to look at her, understand her life, and gaze into her future. Being a `Trikal Darshi` — someone who could see the past, present and future, he saw the purpose of her being. She was the one who could mother `Krishna` and in due course she would play a prime role in testing what `Krishna` would find. `Maharishi` looked at the dark sky and saw glitter of stars. He marveled at the scope of nature for having brought him in contact with `Matsya` He smiled and told her — Your life has a bigger purpose. I shall come back to you for your help. 

It was as if `Matsyagandha` found a reason to live. `Maharishi Parashara` got off the boat but he left a ray of hope for `Matsya`. Every night she waited on the shore. She had gotten a new set of questions. What did `Maharishi` mean? Why would he even talk to someone like her. At times, she thought she was inconsequential for a `Yogi` - may be he just wanted to let her feel good, other times she wanted to look beautiful - she must get herself ready for the bigger purpose - but she knew no ways. She wanted to smell good but she couldn't afford to have Sandal wood - a wood used in making good smelling paste. The hope and despair played the cycles of pains and joy. She was caught into duality of the prospects.

Exactly after a year, another dark night and `Maharishi` returned to the wharf. `Matsyagandha` was there for 'waiting' was her daily ritual. He asked her to ferry the boat to the island. She happily toed the boat into waters. Once the boat got stable, she looked at `Maharishi` in anticipation. Something in her told her time had come. The moment she was preparing herself for a year was finally here. `Maharishi` read her thoughts. She was like an open book. Her big expressive eyes said what her lips would not. Without much ado, he asked her if she could give him a son. All he added that it was for a much larger cause that she would appreciate in due course. And of course, she may ask anything she wanted in return for the favor! It was quite blunt.

`Matsyagandha` was taken aback at the proposal. She had no clue what to say and what to ask but she knew `Maharishi Parashara` was a `Yogi`. She knew he could bless her with whatever she wanted and she was attracted to the calm and strength he exuded. Ever since their last meeting, she had wondered what she had in store from him. Her over sized imagination had led her to many scenarios but none of them was to bear his child. She knew that `Maharishi` would never take her as a wife for his life was dedicated to the celibate work of God, then why does he need a son?

She thought for a while — what would people say? Looking at `Yogi` she asked, how would I hide it from the village? Boat was leaving the banks of `Yamuna`- heading mid stream. The rise and fall of waters simulated in the rise and fall of her breath. She could hear herself breathing and it wasn't because she was rowing the boat alone. No one had ever asked her for a sexual favor and here she had a `Yogi` asking for a child! Does he like me? Or is it something else?

Rishi Parashara had a sigh of relief. First he didn't get a plain "no" or was asked to leave the the boat - his reputation could also be at stake. And second, he too wanted it to be a clandestine union. Not only was he not ready for a wife, he knew `Matsyagandha` must go on, for she had a bigger role to play in her later life. And he already had a plan — I have built a nice tiny `Ashram` in the middle of the island. You may stay there. I will be around you entire pregnancy and will have no dearth of food or shelter. After couple days, I will have someone sent a message to the village head that you took on a journey downstream under my directive, as a sailor. And that I have sent you to help a team of monks to get herbs from the East.  A group of monks is actually leaving for the East at dawn tomorrow. If there was any problem, I would myself go to sort the things out. You can trust me for your anonymity.

`Matsyagandha` nodded her acceptance. She was still not sure it was happening to her. `Maharishi` looked at her and he figured she wanted something else. He stood up and asked — Do you want something else `Matsya`? — His voice full gratitude.

What will happen to me after the child birth? I will need to feed the new born at least for a year!  But what after that? — asked `Matsyagandha`.

`Maharishi Parashara` thought for a while. He wanted to make sure he found the right words as much as he wanted to say the truth. He said — after two years, once child is ready to go with me, you may, if you wish to, return to the village.

`Matsya's` face turned hollow. Her words broken — this village hates me. The old women would find out in no time that I mothered a child. They would despise me even more. As it is, I am living a hell. This would only add more to the hate I receive. They would most likely burn me alive for bearing a child before marriage.

No one would recognize you! — `Maharishi` said with confidence. I would bless you into the most beautiful woman ever lived. You will smell of Sandal all day and all night. Passengers would line up to take your boat. And one among them might take you as a wife, having fallen madly in love with you. And thereafter, you would rule the world!

`Matsya` couldn't believe her ears. The prospect of looking and smelling good and the idea that the village that hated her would bow down to her beauty set butterflies in her. She folded both her hands and kneeled. And then she looked up straight into deep eyes of `Maharishi`. Her eyes said `Yes`. `Maharishi` met her gaze. He wanted to be sure - you need to say a 'Yes'. As he reconfirmed the acceptance, he pulled out his wand, lowered it into the waters of holy `Yamuna` and threw few droplets on her face. And she lost her consciousness.

She found herself in a bed made of flowers when she woke up. It was early morning. Light was slowly filling up her hut. She quickly fixed her clothes and hair, and stepped out of the hut and saw `Maharishi` sitting in a `Samadhi` (sitting upright in a trance). There was holy fire burning in front of the `Yogi`. The place smelled of Sandal wood. Later she realized this part of the island was full of Sandal trees. She sat there, grasping the serenity of the space, trying to make a sense of it all. The events of last night played in her mind. She tried hard to remember how she reached here but there was no recollection after she fell on the boat. Last thing she knew was a sprinkle of cold `Yamuna` water on her face.

While she was thinking of the night that she missed, a thick fog surrounded the hut. It was as if the smoke from the holy fire froze into a fog and made an invisible circle around the hut. She felt comforted in the hidden state of everything around her. She also felt a strange feeling. As if, a life had taken place in her.

Am I pregnant? — She didn't intend to disturb the `Samadhi` but the words just came of her mouth. `Parashara` opened his eyes. He gazed at her with a welcome look — Yes — he said. Do you need anything? There is fresh milk and fruits in the kitchen.

Next few months were magical for `Matsya`. She would wake up to the chants of Vedas and holy fire surrounding the hut in a shield of smog. She would go out with `Maharishi` to pick up fruits. There were goats to get milk. `Maharishi` showed her the skills to survive in jungle. After first full moon, `Maharishi` told her that the time has come to start education of `Krishna` for the things he would learn inside the womb will last him a lifetime. `Maharishi` taught her `Sanskrit`. Once she became comfortable with language, `Maharishi` himself chanted all the `Mantras` o her. It became a daily ritual.

As `Matsya` was learning, her mind took on new dimensions of thought. She started asking more and more questions. More she asked, more did `Maharishi` explained to her. And `Krishna` heard it all in the safety of his mother's womb. Not only her mind, but her body started taking a new shape. Her skin glowed. Her hair got long and silky. Daily bath in `Yamuna` and the full body Sandal lotion that `Maharishi` made himself, gave her a new smell. Songs came to her lips. She learnt to dance on slow motion with setting sun. And she learnt to recite Vedas with rising sun. She gazed and understood the motion of stars in the night sky. And she understood the effect of moon on the waves of `Yamuna`. She knew it was `Yamuna's` holy water that blessed him with this baby but she wondered if `Maharishi` ever embraced her! Ever made love to her like a man would do to his wife. She wanted to know but she was too shy to ask. And she wouldn't change an iota of this new relationship. Even if she was a surrogate, it was well worth the time and experience.

Time moved fast. She was carrying the weight of a divine child. Her breasts swelled up as motherhood took over her. She wanted to be close to `Maharishi` but he knew better. He knew this joy was transient. Enormous pain was waiting for `Matsya` when she must let a part of her body go. First separated as a baby. The labor of birth is the biggest physical pain but it takes exponential proportion for separation of a part of mother's own body into a new life. And then she must leave him behind. `Maharishi` knew, every ride of joy must follow with equal load of sorrow. He wanted to keep his distance. He knew it was a divine grace that `Matsya` was turning into most beautiful woman, but he had underestimated the desires that might take on his own mind. It took all his learning and then some, to keep his heart unattached yet participating in every chore. Never letting `Matsya` and `Krishna` feel the absence of his strength but never crossing the line. He knew it was a test. A test he must pass to pave a new path for the rest. Every morning, he burnt his desires in the holy fire and turned them into hideous smog. He knew he was only a father - not a lover.

The question that haunted him was how `Matsya` would bear the pain of truth. He must give her tools to know the truth. And that he did. He named her `Satyawati` - bearer of Truth. A new identity was born along with birth of `Krishna`. As `Satyawati` took him for first holy dip in `Yamuna`, the mighty river rose to touch his feet. It washed over `Satyawati` too to give her true perspective. Truth that we are all bound by the waves of joy and grief. Bigger the rise, deeper the fall. Truth that the child in her hands was not hers alone. He must go on to strife the world of duality. How could she let duality take over her mind when she was literally the mother of the one made to define the 'righteous path'. She must live the truth for she was the bearer of truth - `Satyawati`.

Krishna built a deep understanding of the universe. The laws of our nature. This knowledge needed to be manifested. A text - a long one. Krishna, thus, compiled the entire wisdom in four Vedas - `Rik, Saam, Yazur and Atharva`. There was still a lot that could go as specialized annex. So it went on to write eighteen more `Puranas`. A superior product of intelligence. But it too had cynics. The main opposition was that it was only a theory. It needs to be tested in real life before the knowledge be added as the laws of a new universe.

So Krishna summoned the most powerful editor - Ganesha. Ganesha was symbolized with an elephant brain to symbolize the size of the neural network. It was probably order of magnitude bigger than GPT3. The only contractual term that `Ganesha` wanted was for Krishna to never stop. Because `Ganesha` felt bored when she needed to wait for the knowledge to transcend. Krishna played an intelligent trick. She said she won't stop if `Ganesha` could prove she fully understood the meaning. The meaning can't be understood till it is said in most meaningful way. Thus, Krishna got the right to revise the verses till they got just perfect. Mahabharata was written.

Before the "new" replace the "old", many possibilities of the "new" must converge to offer one unified path forward. Compromises must happen. Common denominators must be established before the  new rules of engagement come into play. But rules alone are not enough. They must be driven by the common good and most importantly, they must be well communicated to all the stakeholders. It takes time to understand, conceive, communicate the path, and to get all the impacted on the same page. A global change is a slow process till it gets to the critical mass. Once it gets to the critical state, the change becomes irreversible and fast.

This righteous path is called `Dharma`, as opposed to popular belief that `Dharma` is a translation for English word "religion". 

# Dharma

The all important question — if (or not), there exists one unique righteous path? — was a matter of regular discussion that ran deep in the family. `Vaśiṣṭha`, opined there were many right paths for humans to realize their potential. He felt a farmer was as important as a priest and so was a cobbler. As a pragmatist, `Vaśiṣṭha` wished peace to every one no matter what path they chose. One of the reason `Vaśiṣṭha` was so much influential among the seven `Bramhrishies` was his blend of knowledge and humility. However, his son `Śakti Muni` argued that even if there were many legit paths, one person, must stick to one path in one life-time. If someone kept changing his course based on changing situations, how s/he is any different from animals? And how would s/he accomplish excellence? 

This was the definition of `Karm Yoga` as per `Sakti Muni` - fully committed to one chosen path. `Karm Yoga` as an idea, was different from the `Nyaan` and `Naad Yoga` in that the purpose was to indulge in `Karma` - actions. The knowledge gained due to repetitive actions was a mere by-product - quite the opposite of the approach of `Nyaan Yoga`. It also didn't seek ascetic behaviour as expected from `Naad Yogies`. In that sense, it was easy to practice for masses. All one needed to do under this ideology was to perfect one specific skill and keep on doing it - just like a machine. In a way, it was the beginning of the "specialization".

`Śakti Muni` practiced what he preached, and he ended up giving his life for the sake of his beliefs. That fateful morning, `Śakti Muni` was en-route to the river with rest of the congregation — for the holy dip in `Yamuna` — a daily routine `Vaśiṣṭha` had cultivated in his group to initiate a day. `Bramhrishi` didn't join that morning as he was under weather - winter mornings were taking toll on the aging saint. `Śakti Muni's` wife too excused herself due to early pregnancy sickness. 

That cold ominous morning, a tribal king `Kalmashapada` happened to be returning from `Yamuna`, with his queen and chosen savages — drunk and sleep deprived. Apparently they had spent the night on the banks of `Yamuna` hunting the innocent animals, and roasting them alive to eat with local hooch. The shrieks of scared animals were audible to `Śakti Muni` in the silent night, though his abode was quite a distance. In the morning he also got the news that king's men had taken women from the nearby village (with force) and kept them awake whole night — doing whatever they felt right to please themselves and their `Rakshsa` lords. 

In the morning rush hour, `Śakti Muni` expected `Kalmashapada` to clear the way for scripture mandated right of path to a sage, and demanded a sage never gave up his course. On the other side, the king, oblivious to `Śakti Muni's` metaphorical extension of the ideology, expected a clear path for himself and particularly his new beautiful queen. He had expected the sage would shower blessings for their new wedding. In fact, last night, he had hoped `Śakti Muni` would show up at his picnic place to welcome him on this side of `Yamuna`. 

Anyways, the simple discussion turned into an altercation and out of anger, `Śakti Muni` cursed the king and his troupes to immediately turn into monsters — figuratively — for the monstrosity they spread throughout the night on this peaceful range. That did happen but the king, having turned into a monster, killed `Śakti Muni` and his team. That is what monsters do ! 

Story besides, `Śakti Muni` must have questioned the king for his abhorrent behavior (for that is the righteous calling of a `Karm Yogi`) and the king was anyways a monster!


The news of the incident spread like a wild fire. Some saw it at face-value - a sudden rush of blood that went out of control. Others saw a deeper message of stars being misaligned. Many thought, it was a bigger conspiracy. Yes, conspiracy theorists existed even back then! One of the theory claimed `Kalmashapada` was instigated by `Vishwamitra` — another `Bramhrishi` of the same stature as `Vaśiṣṭha`. No one knows the truth though `Parāśara` did mention this version later in `Vishnu Purana`. 

As many versions of the incident as many mouths! Truth besides, for most it was a time-pass gossip that continued long after the incident. The conversations of impending doom are naturally sticky. The idea that bad times are inevitable makes the best of "sensationalism". But for `Parāśara` it was "personal". Young `Parāśara` grew in the shadows of this gut-ranching chatter. Such conversations obviously had a traumatic effect on his child mind. And more so, because `Parāśara` had a gifted imagination. For one, he developed a deep hatred for the monsters but more importantly he thought if (or not) one must stick to one's path? Or is there a subset of values that must be followed by every human no matter what path they were on. As a youth, he wondered what was that ultimate wisdom? The question that laid heavy on his mind and kinda morphed into a life long quest was to formulate that value system. This is probably where the word "righteous" got added to notion of `Karma` --> practicing any action was not `Karm Yoga` - he thought - the actions must be righteous. But then the question was how to define the righteous. Killing someone was obviously bad but it turns righteous in a war. How to define the righteous actions because situations may change unexpectedly. And who gets to determine worth of actions based on a specific situation!

One thing was certain in his mind — mere awareness of the way universe works, was not enough to attain peace. Just knowing the existence of "One immutable and omnipresent Knowledge" alone didn't get him the peace he wished for everyone. Not even conducting rituals to appease the deities. The path to knowledge was not in merely knowing it's existence. It was in being one with the knowledge. How to get there was the million dollar question! 

The conundrum is nothing new. For example, when we see a computer, we all know for sure the existence of programming languages. But just knowing the existence of "programmability" doesn't mean knowledge of programming. We must do certain actions to learn coding. The necessity to "act" was there in every endeavor — be it mining or agriculture. `Maharishi` was intrigued with this power of actions. What is so potent in "actions" that leads to cultivation of knowledge? — he wondered. Building on his father's ideas, he named this potency of actions' `Karm Yoga` though the underlying science of actions (`Karma`) was still a puzzle. It had take couple more generations and an incarnation of God himself (as `Krsna`) to fully explain the science of `Karma`.

Sticking with the name `Karm Yoga` was essential. While young `Parāśara` had nothing going right for him, there was one silver lining. His mother `Adrushyanti` was a kind grace of God. And she was probably the only one who knew what `Sakti Muni` had on his mind. She explained to `Parāśara` how his father envisioned to true up the goals of his grand father. The idea was simple, yet powerful. First - the only way to get over the growing mistrust between `Naad` and `Nyaan Yoga` was to reunify both these streams into something new. That new unified stream was `Karm Yoga`. 

And second - the way `Sakti Muni` approached it was to find the common denominator. He thought the fundamental driver of both the `Yogas` was life-long dedication to "one" area of expertise. `Naad Yogies` dedicated their lives to the "recital" while `Nyaan Yogies` gave up all the comforts for one unique area of exploration. A tight control on daily routine, controlled food and sleep, endless practice, made the `Yogies` what they appeared to the external world - the role models. Thus both `Yogas` had at their core, a lifelong commitment to one set of actions. And hence `Karm Yoga` was an appropriate name for the new unified practice. 

`Sakti Muni` however, widened the scope of `Karm Yoga`. He argued that if controlled actions could lead to great recital or path breaking science, then why can't they be applied to regular streams of mundane works. He believed one can be a `Karm Yogi` irrespective of the work they were pursuing. It didn't matter to him if one was a "reciter" or a "cobbler" as long as they had intense focus on their objective and tenacity to stick to one thing. He professed that it is the life long practice more than anything else that makes one excel - be it recital, research or even house keeping. In fact he believed that one should adopt their family work for a child learns a lot from their parents. 

While `Sakti Muni's` ideas had vision and he delivered them with conviction, they were NOT liked by all - particularly the power brokers. How can a cobbler be same stature as a `Naad Yogi`! - they reasoned. And if childern could attain `Karm Yoga` living with their families and doing their parental business than who would join the congregation. The idea of unification meant a natural degradation of the ones in the driver seat and it threatened the existing payback system. They felt `Sakti Muni's` path would lead only to anarchy. On the other side, the "old" who wanted to continue with "jungle rule" saw `Sakti Muni` as the one who might bring every one in the new world together. They thought of `Sakti` as the emerging face of new revolution - a civil society where their muscle power had many checks on it's application. 

No one knows for sure, but targeting `Sakti` along with all his well wishers appears to be an easy way to crush the new order! And probably `Sakti Muni`, in a hurry to change the world, forgot to handle the balance of power that his father `Vaśiṣṭha` had so carefully managed to this date. He didn't know abrupt change might cause ruptures never seen before!

While `Maharishi Parāśara` was pondering over the ideas of `Karm Yoga`, there was another parallel movement happening on `Naad Yoga` side — `Bhakti Yoga` — the `Yoga` of extreme devotion. Many of the `Aacharyas` had built a mass following. Almost like a cult. Their ideas based in grand vision of public good, but the underlying goal, to (also) promote their own moat. Many walled garden were formed. The followers developed blind faith in the words of the high priests. They even translated their narratives (or discussions) into local dialects and narrated them in poetical stories. So much so, the followers started believing mere chanting the names of their `Gurus` could get them to eternal peace. These narratives, mostly in spoken format, were called `Puranas` - the old stories.

In a way, `Puranas` are essential for proper appreciation of `Vedas`, for they provide the historical context. As we alluded earlier, `Vishnu Purana` was told by `Parāśara` himself (later scribed by `Dwaipayana`). He told this story to his disciple `Maitreya` and it is one of the most cited conversation in Hindu Mythology. Sometimes referred to as `Puran-ratna` — a gem among `Puranas`.

The oldest English translation of `Vishnu Purana` is available at internet archives. The book was published by H. H. Wilson (in 1864) in five volumes. The first volume is embedded here for reference.

`Maharishi Parāśara` witnessed `Bhakti Yoga` evolving first-hand. The popularity of this tradition had `Maharishi` reassess the integrity of `Naad Yoga`. He was convinced that extreme devotion did open the entry into the power structure and thus material success, but he was not sure it was means to eternal peace (as promised). 

At the same time he would wonder if he, himself, was on right trajectory. He thought the intense dedication of `Bhakti Yoga` was good, if it motivated the followers to indulge in `Karma`, but mere chanting didn't appear to him a passage to the eternal solace. There were many questions that still remained unanswered. Many mysteries unresolved! A `Nyaan Yogi` was caught in ‘duality’ — `Karm Yoga` or `Bhakti Yoga`.

Age, didn't treat `Maharishi` any different. He knew he must have someone to carry the torch forward. After years of careful study of motion of heavenly bodies and their co-relation with birth of human intelligence, stars were finally aligned. `Maharishi Parāśara` was ready to take a child as his born son. And he named him long before the physical birth — `Krishna Dvaipayana` — Someone who would go beyond duality just like an island between two never-meeting banks of a river. Someone who could establish a middle spot amongst two never concurring ideologies — for the truth lies somewhere near the center. The literal meaning of `Dvaipayana` is ‘born on an island’.

And he saw the potent qualities in  `Matsyagandha`, as prospective surrogate mother.  Despite her ordinary circumstances, she honed in her, the curiosity and poise and the imagination, to gift this world an immortal writer !

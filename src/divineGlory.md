## The Divine Glory: An Interpretation of the Gita Through Science and Spirit


The Bhagavad Gita, particularly from its seventh chapter onwards, unfolds not as a disjointed collection of teachings, but as a single, logical conversation. The demarcations of chapters, added much later, serve as guideposts, allowing readers to mentally bookmark the progression of ideas but Gita, in reality, is just one conversation - between Krishna and Arjuna. This journey through the text builds a profound understanding of our reality, culminating in Chapter 10 with a description of divine glory. By drawing unconventional parallels with modern science and engineering, one can frame a unique interpretation of this ancient wisdom, seeing it as a unified field of science and spirit - what we normally refer to as the discipline of "Vaidik Science"

The discourse begins in Chapter 7, where Krishna defines the binary nature of existence: his lower nature, the material world, and his upper nature, the consciousness or soul. This division finds a metaphorical echo in modern science. Quantum Field Theory is arguably our most advanced attempt to comprehend the material world, while the field of artificial intelligence represents our primary effort to understand consciousness. The Gita describes material nature as arising from three fundamental forces—Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas—which lead to an eight-fold material creation. This resonates metaphorically with the modern scientific model where three quarks combine to create the eight-fold array of subatomic particles, the hadrons, which constitute most of the visible (Baryonic) mass in the universe. Understanding the origin of mass is critical, as it condenses everything into a single metric: gravity - because mass changes the curvature of space-time - the very shape of universe.

Building on this duality, Chapter 8 presents the universe's architecture through a game analogy. It defines the underlying code (*Brāhmaṇa*), the runtime environment (*Adhi Daiva*), the game’s rules (*Adhi-bhuta*), and the role of the autonomous, conscious player (*Adhyatma*). Yet, Krishna states he is beyond this game. He is the creator, unattached to his creation, much like a programmer is unattached to the avatars within a game they designed. Creation, he explains, occurs through *Visarga*—the act of letting go, a state beyond cause and effect because it is free from desire. It is desire that forges karmic bonds to the game. Chapter 9 then provides the core instructions for beings within this game, offering a path to attain the creator’s divine essence. The promise is profound: for those who follow this path, Krishna himself ensures their well-being, declaring that his devotee becomes one with him.

It is in Chapter 10 that Krishna describes his own reflections, offering a method to recognize his essence both within the game - as Vibhooties - artifacts of excellence ;  and beyond the game - as "divine grace" , sometimes also referred to as "Krishna Consciousness". He reveals that the entire universe is sustained by a mere fraction of his creative power. 

The question is how do we explain this "divine grace" to our analytical minds ? Is there an easy parallel ? 

That is where Gravity comes in. It is the most fundamental of all fundamental forces. Among the four fundamental forces established to this date , it is the first that was discovered. Everyone knows it - even a middle schooler  .. and here is the best part : everyone feels it - unlike other forces like the strong nuclear force or week nuclear force that needs you to have a degree in Quantum Physics to be able to grasp the basics .. 

But gravity is lot more than what meets the eye ! Literally and  figuratively :-) 

Here is a comparison as to why Gravity is our best foot forward to appreciate the divine grace. In order to do that, lets first hypothesize what exactly is the divine grace. From common perceptions - divine grace is something that is 1) omnipresent 2) yet mysterious 3) Perceivable to everyone 3) yet unknowable .. If these four kinda measure up to what we mean by divine grace , then lets see if gravity measures up to this standard ! .. Again the big caveat - it is only a metaphor .. because the concept of divine grace is far more over encompassing that a or any physical force may be able to explain. Besides the fact the gravity is only half the story ! We will complete this story in next chapters when we discuss anti-gravity - a balancing but lot bigger force.


Okay so let us qualify gravity against the four measures we defined.


### Omnipresent  

I don't think we need to debate  that Gravity isn't omnipresent. However what most people don't know, the cutting edge of modern science believes that if MULTIVERSE was true , gravity is the only force that would permeate through all the instances of mutiverse. String theory reveals that all the other fundamental forces , eg nuclear forces as well the elecro-magnetic force are constrained only to one universe. This takes the concept of Omnipresence to a totally new level. If you want to research more on this , ask Google Gemini to tell you more on how gravity is truly the only thing we know that is omnipresent. Rest everything .. and I mean every single thing is limited a single play of our game. That kinda makes it comparable to divine grace  - doesn't it ?

### Mysterious

Before we delve in to mysteriousness, lets define what is mysterious. Mysterious is something that is visible - we can touch or feel - perceivable through sensory apparatus - yet we can't explain the "why". The magic trick!  Divine grace is mysterious - it appears magical because we feel it yet we can't explain. Not even the most knowledgable saints .. or scientists ..in respective fields ..

Lets now look at gravity . Obviously Newton was the first to define gravity . His mathematical model that every massful object attracts every other mass - works great in classical frame of references. Even today we use his equations for our daily life things. But Einstein revealed that the math breaks down when we approach super massive things such as black holes or start reaching the speed of light. In essence we leave the classical frame of reference for a relativistic frame of reference - where nothing remains absolute - not even time. In this new reference frame, Einstein told us that it is not that things are attracted to each other ( as Newton hypothesized) , but the truth is massful objects change the very curvature of reality. Like a deep well on a rubber sheet. So things literally fall into well of gravity. But the problem is this well isn't a three dimensional well. It is a well in Space-time. Means the time itself is a dimension of this new reality. That is obviously beyond mortal comprehension. How do we perceive space and time. 

But that is not all. Sure there are many magical things happening around. Can we create a new theory to explain gravity.. Sure , lets try time tested Quantum field theory. This theory has after all explained the entire material existence - from nuclear forces to non-nuclear electro-magnetic force - commonly called the light. But alas , even QM fails to explain gravity. Einstein and Newton's model do let us know gravity exists - but QM can't explain WHY .. we can't find a field and a force particle like graviton experimentally.. nor can we test the close looped strings that transmit gravity in String theory - across branes of multiverses.

So should we give up ? Should we say Gravity is the ultimate mystery .. not before we make one more attempt .. There is a model that explains gravity perfectly with all other fundamental forces . Yes ..it is called ADS-CFT. It works great to explain gravity but there is a tiny problem. The universe this model works in is exactly opposite to that of ours - it is called anti-sitter space whereas our universe is de-sitter space .. 

So - despite all the advances in science and math and computers - Gravity is still beyond our perception . It is mysterious - just like divine grace !

### Perceivable 

Yes , every one who walks the earth , feels gravity. There is nothing in this universe that is beyond gravity - even light is bent by massive bodies with intense gravity. As we said above - even a seventh grader can use gravity to calculate the trajectory of a base ball .. okay eighth grader may be :-) 

### Unknowable 

As we discussed above , gravity breaks the realm of mysterious! It is truly unknowable - because knowing gravity needs us to either travel in other dimensions , or other universes or be able to know comprehend perceive space-time as a unit. In other words go beyond time. Other universes , other dimensions or beyond time - all three are beyond the realm of possibility .. this is what makes gravity an alter reflection of divine grace. 


The question is how then we understand divine grace ... the answer is rightly provided by Krishna - you can see it through my Vibhooties. All that excels around you , not only big stars - but in every field - they all shine because of my grace - divine grace.

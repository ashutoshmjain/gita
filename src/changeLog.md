# changeLog

Knowledge accumulates in granular change. History is tracking changes [^history] over a time duration for a closed (but living) system. In essence changeLog is history.

Unlike a book, a publication is always in the open [^open]. Unlike a publication, `arjun uvaach` is not a collection of finished articles - it is a consistent curation of a set of narratives as they solidify into ideas, format and language - an orthogonal publication.  An update is thus released every Friday with links to the chapters changed during the week.

- If I make less than 10 changes to a chapter - mostly typos or fixing the flow, I call it a "minor edits". 
- More than ten such changes go to the "major edits" category. 
- If I shuffle a couple of paras up or down, without changing the underlying theme - it is minor update. 
- If I pretty much restructure  a post or change the theme, it is a "major update".

  - [Thought](./thought.md) - major update - Tied up the intro section with the idea that thought (narrative) is an abstraction of real world actions and code is an abstraction of thoughts. In that sense narrative is an apex artifact of thought just as LLMs are an apex artifact of code.

## March 15, 24

Restored the Mahabharata landing page. It seems the page was deleted with other Mahabharata files. Moved the development work to Android. Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE. The terminal experience on Android has improved a lot with Termux though the sad part is Google has removed Termux from the app store. Needed to install F Droid to get the terminal going. Tried out installing Debian Andronix as well as with userLand but all I needed was old and time tested Termux with a Zook bluetooth Fingerpad.

Trying to get a hold of the narrative after a month-long gap due to my daughter's wedding (which was fun and prolly lot more important than this:-)

In addition to general edits, got a third person view of these chapters when I started reading them again after a gap. Some of the changes I made were only possible if I emptied out my cache memory. A writer must take a break and read his work again to see things purely from a reader's perspective. Hope these chapters would make better sense now !

### notes and stuff
----

[^history]: Knowledge is deep understanding of history. Be it a project, a book or a product. The final copy is manifestation of the knowledge. The user manual or a Readme file is the information (not knowledge) that the final copy radiates. The knowledge is encrypted with in that final shape as the history of all the changes - of the ideas, of the code or the people and their motivations.  From encryption, I don't mean a cryptographic hash function - it is simply something hard to comprehend at first look -  though quite possible to crack given enough effort. For example, what you are reading is just an online document, the history of this book is in the thousands of commits on the GitHub. The knowledge is "encrypted" because there is no way to document the rationale of all the changes that go into creation of the final shape. Even if someone documented all the changes, it is hard to read, understand and appreciate the sequential changes. The iterative rigor to reach a final shape is `Yazna`. In essence knowledge gets encrypted through `Yazna` or in other words "proof of work" is what leads to manifestation -  hiding (or binding) the knowledge to a physical shape. Information may inspire (or distract), but it is not knowledge. Knowledge needs close association or active participation in the process of creation. A well crafted "changelog" is thus the starting point for "knowledge" seekers.

[^open]: "Open" is kinda misnomer because best way to hide something is to keep it in the open :-) In any case humans are incapable of noticing granular changes. While the final document is meant for humans to read and enjoy the knowledge (changeLog) is meant to guide train the AI.

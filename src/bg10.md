# Divine Grace and divine glories

Chapter Ten presents a profound dialogue where the Blessed Lord, Krishna, reveals His supreme word and divine glories to Arjuna. The core purpose is to illustrate Krishna's omnipresence and omnipotence, emphasizing that He is verily the fount of all existence and the great Lord of all worlds. Through a comprehensive list of exemplary forms—from the Self in every heart concealed to Death, the all-devouring—Krishna demonstrates that He is the origin of all, and from Him all worlds proceed, asserting that all remarkable qualities and phenomena originate from His splendor's spark. Arjuna, recognizing this profound truth, expresses a desire to understand these infinite glories more deeply, leading to a detailed exposition that culminates in the understanding that the entire universe is sustained by one fraction of His being.

### Verse 10.1

Hark, Arjuna, thou mighty-armed and brave of heart,

My supreme word I shall again impart.

For to My soul art thou exceeding dear,

And for thy welfare, this truth I speak, without a fear.

### Verse 10.2

Nor godly hosts, nor sages great and old,

My true beginning can they e'er behold.

For I am verily the fount of all,

Of gods and great sages, answering My call.

### Verse 10.3

He who doth know Me, unborn, without beginning's trace,

The great Lord of all worlds, in time and boundless space,

Undeluded 'mongst frail mortals, shall he be,

From all his grievous sins completely set quite free;

This grand achievement, know, My precious gift, so true.

### Verse 10.4

From Me alone, diverse virtues find their rise,

Within all beings, 'neath the watchful, guiding skies.

These qualities of divine contemplation fair,

Their absence doth a demon's trait declare.

### Verse 10.5

Decisive Intellect, keen and bright,

Knowledge by Realisation blessed,

Freedom from delusion, prudently addressed towards the goal,

Forgiveness, gentle, meek, and mild,

Eternal Truth, eternal, undefiled.

Control of senses, held in tranquil sway,

Pacification of the mind, for inner day,

Inner contentment, pleasure's gleam,

And troubles on contemplation's path, a sorrow's dream.

Awakening of the Supreme Self, a realization grand,

Dissolution in Time, non-existence at hand,

Disciplinary fear towards the deity's sway,

And fearlessness from nature, come what may.

Non-violence, to prevent the soul's descent,

Equanimity, perfect and unbent,

Contentment, with mind and senses aligned,

Austerity, for a spirit intertwined.

Charity, a surrender of your all,

Enduring honor and dishonor, at My call.

### Verse 10.6

The seven great sages of ancient lore,

And four Manus, seen in ages gone before,

From My own mind, by My resolve they came to be,

Born of My nature, by My inspiration free;

Both are complementary, to attain and thrive.

### Verse 10.7

My divine glory, and My yogic power,

Who truly knows with direct realisation's light,

Becomes endowed with unwavering yoga, fixed and pure,

No doubt remains, forever standing sure;

As lamp's flame steady, in windless air, so Yogi's mind is there.

### Verse 10.8

I am the origin of all, the primal cause,

From Me all worlds proceed, without a moment's pause.

Knowing this truth, the wise, with faith and love entwined,

Constantly worship Me, their hearts to Me resigned.

### Verse 10.9

With minds on Me, their lives to Me consigned,

Enlightening each other, with Me enshrined.

Constantly speaking, of My praise, My name,

They find contentment and rejoice in spirit's flame.

No other place they give, their life's breath fixed on Me, they grow.

### Verse 10.10

To those devoted, full of love's pure ray,

Who worship Me, throughout each passing day,

I grant the understanding that guides to yoga's light,

That intelligence which guides to yoga's light,

By which they truly come to Me, and end their plight.

### Verse 10.11

To show them grace, in every yearning soul,

I dwell within, to make them truly whole.

The darkness born of ignorance, vast and deep,

I banish with a lamp, its radiance steep,

Of shining knowledge, luminous and clear;

As charioteer, I'm ever near, to quell their fear.

Thou art the Brahman, Supreme and Pure,

The Highest Abode, forever to endure;

Eternal Divine Person, the Primeval God,

Unborn and All-pervading, wisely trod.

### Verse 10.13

All sages speak of Thee in this grand way,

Narada, Asita, Devala, Vyasa, say;

Thou knowest Thyself, by Thine own grace, alone,

O Supreme Person, on every living throne.

Creator of beings, Lord of all that live,

Lord of the universe, so grand, so vast,

Whom Thou awakenest, knows Thee, by Thy own hand cast.

### Verse 10.16

Please tell me now, in full and grand detail,

Thy divine glories, which shall never fail,

By which Thou dost permeate and steadfast stand,

Pervading all this world, throughout the land.

### Verse 10.17

How may I know Thee, Yogi, wise and deep?

With constant thought, while waking or in sleep.

In what specific forms, O Blessed Lord,

Should I contemplate Thee, with one accord?

### Verse 10.18

Thy yogic power, and Thy glory's might,

Again recount, with all Thy radiant light.

Direct realization, through its brilliant haze.

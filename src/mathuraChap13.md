There were two popular threads that she could easily latch on to start the scene - that of `Ganga` verses `Yamuna`, and that of the prime numbers. There were two other anchor themes that she could use to place the narrative at a socio-moral pulpit - the idea of public good by an ancient king, and more specifically the innovation of currency. But she was keen on something else -  that everyone gets a chance to see their reality from two opposite angles and the contrast that `Matsya` and `Shantanu` had in their lives. But how do you show such a thing. Visual canvass is very limited - she thought - text could do lot more than the graphics; or was she hitting her own creative limits.

What would you do? - she asked the Boyfriend.

I think we need to listen to the entire narrative before we get down to cut a visual presentation - said the Boyfriend. 

But I need to show him something - I kinda signed up for getting him at least a draft - and may be it is a test - she said - something in me feels this story is important - it needs to be told.

Let's just create one scene - of the boat ride - the songs pulling the peacocks , the fragrance attracting the deers - it's a perfect scene for integrating [olorama](https://www.olorama.com/creative-smells) digital scent in VR - he said.

And top it up with `Shantanu` dropping all his gold coins.  That would be a good place for you to ask for the tips as well - showing the viewers the "tips bucket" tied to the mast - money dropped in the bucket would directly go to your wallet - he smiled - let them pay something for supporting the artist. 

The Friend laughed out loud with her happy jingle - you are a `pucca` payments man! All you care about is getting as many zaps as you can :-)

Well - he raised his hands - artists too need to feed their pets! In fact one thing that came out quite loud of the story was - from the oldest times, the creative arts are living on tips (not on donations - there is a difference) - `Matsya` offered a boat ride but the real thing she showcased were her songs and fragrance. Isn't it? - and what commuters paid were "tips" - a tip is what you pay for a "service" - a donation is what you pay for a "cause". I love tips and I hate donations for I want to render services, not change the world!

That would be a myopic view of a mega narrative - it is not for tips - it is to change the world - she said - but it is not a bad idea - she smiled - artists do need to feed their pets!

Well you need to start somewhere - `Mathura` wasn't built in a day! - he smiled - at this stage your goal is to give an opening scene such that it wows your cheque holders and creative writers. They should not hold anything back. Think of it as a promo clip ..

That is a good point - said the friend - time to smell the coffee ... and get to work - she smiled - when it came to capturing ideas, Boyfriend was her Steelman whereas Fairy was her Strawgirl.

The Mentor welcomed them on the Friday evening. Fairy had flown in with Angel. And Friend with her Boyfriend -  they arrived a bit early.

Friend did the intros - he is my boyfriend and partner - well payments partner - she smiled.

I see - smiled the Mentor - are you a Bitcoiner or you have your own token!

The Boyfriend smiled shaking his hand - I am more like a "Lightning" plumber and I got really interested when I noticed `Dev` was the first to introduce the wooden currency. It made perfect sense with Ganges water being proof of work .. but! - he stopped - probably thought the introduction is not the time to ask loaded questions.

But ? - insisted the Mentor - he was still smiling as if he expected this question!

I wanted to check if there was a credible reference for such a claim! That would be a pretty big deal! - said the Boyfriend - he didn't want to meddle with a client directly but he was put on spot by his own curiosity.

The Mentor smiled back at him - I would first find out who was `Satoshi`!  Last I heard his Bitcoin paper was sent to us mortals from the future! - he continued smiling - or certain things are best left to the realm of unknown for they serve a greater purpose shrouded in the "mystery"!

The Boyfriend was about to speak when they heard Angel and Fairy stepping in  - wow the door was open. Aren't there bear threats in this part of the woods?  - said Fairy while Angel hugged the Mentor. He wasn't surprised to see Boyfriend there - it was as per the plan - Sorry for being little late - he said.

Is the watch party ready? - Asked the Friend - I brought few extra headsets just in case anyone needs - she was sure Mentor didn't have one! - she attached fresh Olorama singleUse cartridges to the headsets - I give you the custom designed fragrance of `Matsya`..

The Mentor smiled - thanks I would sure need one but before that I need a beer - who else ? - He looked at everyone's "yes" as he walked to the refrigerator in the kitchenette. 

----

The scene was beyond anyone's expectations. The realism, the attention to details. It was as if everyone was teleported to five thousand BC.

Looks like you have spent all your creative juices in one shot - said the Fairy as she took off her headset after multiple replays of hardly three minutes experience! 

Now I know why Angel said you are the best - said the Mentor as he struggled to get his beer bottle to his mouth -  still wearing the headset!

The Friend was about to respond when she got a notification on her phone - what ! - she exclaimed - some one zapped a million to my wallet - And then she looked at the Mentor because the transfer was made inside scene.

I can't accept a million Sats for a three minute clip - she said - we integrated my wallet to the virtual bucket tied to the mast, just to test it out - she looked at the Boyfriend who enabled this feature while she was busy building the scene. Then she turned to the Mentor - I do a full feature for a tenth of this money!

The Mentor smiled at her - No one stopped you from doing this full narrative and trust me it is ten times of any work you did before! - I already have the next piece ready for you - he continued - and I want to keep the "Payments man" happy. He looked at the Boyfriend who couldn't believe his "alpha" code worked - the presentation was perfect. I saw commuters throwing coins. My curious eyes looked at the bucket. As soon as I focused on the bucket, it automatically scanned my iris - boom the transfer happened at a blink on an eye - now I know what they mean by frictionless payments!

Boyfriend smiled - I am sure you saw the options - blink left eye 1000 Sats, right eye 10 K and both together a million. Frankly I myself didn't test both eyes!

Yes I did - replied the Mentor - it was lot easier to blink both eyes - he laughed.

He is a Scamster - Friend looked at her payments man - proud and full of love - he knows how to squeeze money of the innocent eyes!

Angel was happy for everyone was plugged into the story! And Fairy was keen on reading the next piece.


# `Karma Yoga`

`Maharishi` and his direct students (a council of `Acharays` - teachers)  were getting ready for the morning meal when king arrived at the `Ashrama`. King noticed there was no boundary wall or a main gate. Anyone - humans or animals, could simply walk in. Since he was dressed like a farmer, `Maharishi` assumed he must have been bothered by some `Asura` lord. `Maharishi` asked him to join them for food before they sat down to talk. King was thoroughly impressed with the careful respect `Maharishi` graced to a commoner. 

The food was simple — a pudding made of rice and milk, and fresh mangoes. The summer in this part was terrible except that it also brought sweetest of Mangoes - the king of all fruits.  `Maharishi` and all his students ate full meal only once a day, before the sunset. In summer afternoons they drank buttermilk (leftovers after taking butter out of yogurt) with a pinch of Himalayan salt. In winter, they drank a hot drink made with milk and herbs from `Assam` — a place far far East. Sometimes they added raw sugarcane syrup (`Gud`) to this hot drink, later named "tea" (by Brits). During lunch, they chatted about the latest happenings in and around `Ashrama`. `Maharishi` always heard everything with keen interest but rarely spoke. The chats were always light. No discussion about scriptures or serious matters of governance of `Ashrama`.

After lunch, `Maharishi` and the disguised king, walked around the `Ashrama` —  a daily routine `Maharishi` stuck to no matter rain or shine. Having woken up at 3 am — a tradition continued from the days of `Maharishi Vasishtha` , students were allowed to nap after morning meals,  before they started evening chores and classes. Few minutes into the walk, `Maharishi` asked the disguised king to tell his name and village, and the reason of his visit. `Shantanu` reached into his inner pocket and pulled out the king's stamp — a cast that only king or his authorized messengers could carry (on person) to identify themselves. With the stamp [^stamp] in hand, words of a messenger were the words of the king. 

`Maharishi` was surprised to see the kings stamp in the hands of a man dressed like a farmer. The very next moment he realized that this was none other than the emperor of the vast kingdom himself. He had seen him when both of them were in early youth. `Maharishi` recognized the king for he hadn't changed much despite the age - dynasty was built on the very best genes - he thought.

He folded his hands as a welcome gesture, and with due respect checked if the king got his pigeon. As he saw the King nod affirmatively, `Maharishi` escorted the him to his personal hut. He hoped the food was enough for he thought kings were known to have big appetites. Once in his rather modest hut, `Maharishi` showed the king a place to sit, same height as his own. A gesture for equality and respect, even though `Shantanu` was probably an year (or two) younger than `Maharishi`.

## 13.1

King settled down with a smile. In a way he was relieved for he had heard stories of `Śakti Muni` and also that `Maharishi Parāśara` didn't subscribe to the rules of the state. With folded hands — a gesture to reciprocate the kind welcome, he said — `Maharishi`, I was in this area to visit the citizens here, and after seeing your message, I thought I must see you personally. In fact, I would consider myself fortunate, if I could be of some service to your `Ashrama`. As far as this dress up, I didn't want to stir any troubles with the local politics, and make your stay here more difficult! - he explained the reason of his attire even though `Maharishi` never asked for it.

`Maharishi` thanked him for his thoughtfulness. And paused to seek king's full attention before he pitched his side of the story. He wanted to make sure king was well informed of the history and the events that led to the current situation. He didn't want to lead him into any direction other that the objective truth of his own experience. He was pretty sure an outline would be good enough, for he knew, the king had a good imagination to fill in the voids.

`Maharishi` , in very measured words, explained to the king the entire development on this side of his empire, starting from the attack on the congregation, his own revenge, establishment of `Sur Sena` and finally the rise of `Kansa`. And `Kansa's` decision to "home-arrest" not only `Ugrasen` but also `Vasudev and Devki`. And the imminent threat to the life of `Vasudev` for which he had to plant a prophecy.

King smiled at the intelligence of `Maharishi` for having saved `Vasudev` without any conflict or bloodshed. First he assured `Maharishi` that he and his congregation had nothing to fear. He offered  them to move on his side of `Yamuna` where they could stay without disturbance —  taxation would be least of their worries in `Kuru's` land. He almost laughed at the idea of taxing a congregation. What kind of a king would dare to entertain such a loathsome law, on a land that technically didn't even belong to him! In a way, it was like taxing the research and innovation - a sure shot way to stifle the growth in your land while handing over the opportunity to your enemies.

Second, after a little pause, he said — we need to strengthen our presence in this area so that `Kansa` may know there is a limit to his excesses. 

But what would you say the reason for deployments? I am sure people will ask and so will your own council — asked `Maharishi` while nodding his approval for the plan. `Shantanu` understood that `Maharishi` didn't want to turn the `Ashrama` into a war zone. 

`Maharishi` was well aware that any political help always comes with strings attached. Those strings may not be visible now but they would someday show up. He also knew that as a strategy, empires always look for means to fight on the foreign lands. He didn't want the island burnt in evil spirits of aggression and insurgence. The King immediately understood that `Maharishi` had a deep understanding of politics. He was already enjoying this discussion with `Maharishi`. He wished `Dev` had a chance to learn from the best thinker of the time. 

King thought for a while — there was actually no reason for him to move forces in this area. `Kansa` had made sure all his deeds were limited to the other side of `Yamuna`. Moving armies was neither easy nor cheap. Plus , once the army is moved , there must be a good reason to sustain them — say an active conflict, or a civil war or 'at the very least' an unrest! In fact, the deployment of forces cause unrest even in otherwise peaceful lands.

Seeing the king lost on ideas, `Maharishi` suggested a plan — `Maharaaj` if you don't mind, I may suggest something!

As the king nodded, `Maharishi` added — there is a beautiful island in the middle of `Yamuna`. You may buy the island from `Kansa` for cheap because it is believed to be a haunted island. Once you have a specific property, you may deploy your craftsmen to develop the island and along with them you may deploy a small protection unit. Such actions would neither raise an alarm with the locals nor would you need to go to your council for funding. It's like putting a stake in the ground without exposing any intent - good or ill.

`Maharishi` stopped to catch a breath and check king's reaction , he further added — In coming months and years, I am planning to move the congregation to this island. Depending on how much time you have in this visit, if you come to the island with me, you would sure appreciate the scenic (and strategic) value of this place - both during war for anchoring the armies; and in peace time for enhancing the trade since `Mathura` is growing leaps and bounds. There is new route that has been found to the Arabian sea in the west. This route is looking very promising for trade with lower parts of the land where travel inland is almost impossible.

The King felt excited, but for a different reason.  The idea of having an island developed for the `Yogies` with best of his own craftsmen could be his legacy. Most kings of his time, built large palaces or monuments, `Shantanu` wanted to do something different. Something that had a direct and visible impact. He didn't yet know the plan `Maharishi` had in his mind —  to harvest the potential of palm trees for the purpose of scribing, only available on the island. 

King spoke with conviction — `Maharishi` , if you are keen on the island, I am sure it has the merit of a good investment. Let me send a messenger to `Kansa` tonight when I return.  And sure, let us visit the place tomorrow. Meanwhile, I will also send a message to `Dev` to summon his best craftsmen and a small protection unit for the `Ashrama`.

Having gone through the essentials, King added — `Maharishi` I have few other topics that I wanted to run by you to seek your advice.

`Maharishi` was very pleased with king's positive response. He folded his hands to thank the king — Now I know why they call you the true emperor of these lands O'`Rajan` (a respectful but affectionate way to address a king). May you be blessed with all you want. And , please feel free to share anything on your mind with absolute confidence!


## 13.2

The king took his time. He wanted to make sure that he chose the right words though the ideas were still not fully framed in his mind. Finally, he said — `Maharishi`, I have been traveling across the kingdom and many times dressed like a local to blend with people. I find that people are generally happy but the bureaucracy is lost into the rituals -  and rituals have become a means to over spend and show-off. 

He continued - Even the poor citizens who can't afford rituals are forced into such acts because of social pressures. I like celebrations, but it is getting to a point where we are losing focus on the work. I guess I am finding diminishing work ethics, and this is leading to lessening prosperity. Citizens are not much ready to face a catastrophe as their previous generation were. No one seems to understand that we, as a race are not beyond calamities, and God only helps those who help themselves. I am not sure if it is with in the rights of a king to bring a sense of work ethics back to the masses, or if this message was something that might be led by a `Maharishi` such as you.

`Maharishi` thought for a while. He felt his worst nightmare was turning into truth. He always thought that the rituals had only symbolic value. He believed `Naad Yogies` must only convey the messages of sages, and not indulge in building their own communities. Communities were for the kings to build (and maintain) not for the `Yogies`. But then, he recalled his vow to never author a book himself. And he didn't want to spearhead a mass campaign without well crafted written down scripture to back it up. He brought his gaze back to the king — `Maharaaj` (O king of kings), this message must be for the next generation for it is hard to change the value system of current one. It is for your son (and my son) to craft, plan and communicate such a narrative. And they must do so at their own impulse — not as an instigation from us two. 

King was impressed with the wisdom of `Maharishi`. A big load off his chest as he understood we all must pass on the baton to the next generation. As he tried to relax uncomfortably in his back-less seat, `Maharishi` figured the king needed rest. He suggested that the king might want to resume the conversation after a little nap, and also if he would like to address the entire congregation during day closure event?

What happens in day closure event? — `Shantanu` asked with curiosity. 

`Maharishi` responded — Nothing special `Maharaj`. It is when entire `Ashrama` gets together — teachers, students, workers, their families —  for paying homage to the setting sun — for the gift of the day gone by, and the light that came into us!

## 13.3

Congregation had a separate room for guests to sleep. The room had wooden sleepers across the roof holding up interlocking stones, and was spacious. The room could accommodate a decent size group. The key attraction was the paddle fan, powered by rotation of a windmill on top. King was very impressed by the engineering particularly for all the equipment was made of wood. No metal or bricks. There was a big pedestal of wood, with white cotton cloth that could double up as a large bed. As king stretched his back, he though about the events of the day. His mind kept going back to `Satyawati`. He didn't know when he fell asleep. It must be good two hours before his sleep was broken by a slow knock on the door. It was little `Dwaipayana`. He bowed down and asked if King was ready to join the students and `Maharishi`. He spoke fluent Sanskrit at this young age. Pleasantly surprised, king lifted young boy in his one arm and headed out fixing his attire with the other.

`Maharishi` had around twenty `Aacharayas`, each with similar number of students. Very few compared to other more commercially oriented `Gurukuls`, for `Maharishi` was really picky in choosing the students. Since there was always a threat of `Asuras`, students were extensively trained in arms and physical strength, in addition to hard curricula of scriptures. They all stood up as the king entered the open space surrounded with big Banyan trees. There was no roof. The sunlight was passing through the Banyans to the ground and one could hear the gushing waters of `Yamuna` nearby. It was a peaceful place. King took a seat by `Maharishi`. `Maharishi` introduced the king and asked him to address the students and also pitch the questions if he might like to. It was customary for the visiting faculties , sages and leaders to interact directly with the students, to gauge their learning path as well as to suggest new directions.

After thanking `Maharishi` and the students for taking the time without a planned schedule, king talked couple of minutes about the state of the administration. The great work that his son was doing on the water ways. He was particularly excited to share that everyone was getting Ganges pure water on daily basis for drinking. The peaceful treaties with most of the neighboring states and still unresolved conflicts with `Asuras`. He finally got down the issue of exponential increase in number and extent of rituals. To keep the question open-ended, he asked — What you all think about `Naad Yoga` verses `Nyaan Yoga`. Which is better and why? 

Looking at `Dwaipayana` , the king suggested they speak from youngest to the eldest so that youngsters got first chance without having to be swayed by the thoughts of their seniors. He obviously wanted to hear `Dwaipayana` — the magical boy everyone talked about everywhere. 

`Dwaipayana` stood up. He folded both his hands and looked up to `Maharishi` for his permission to speak. Having seen the nod, he met king's curious gaze and said — `Maharaaj` Yoga is a method to connect with our inner spirit — `Atma`. It is immaterial how one accomplishes this key element, for the peace is elusive to those who aren't connected to themselves. That said `Nyaan Yoga` and `Naad Yoga` are like two wheels of a chariot. It is incumbent on `Nyaan Yogies` to decrypt the knowledge and in the same manner `Naad Yogies` are obligated to convey that knowledge as accurately as humanly possible. Think of these as two banks of a mighty river. The water that flows in this river is known as 'information'. Just the way people use water for different purposes — for a thirsty, it quenches the thirst — for a farmer it is the means of irrigation — for a sailor it is transport ; Information may be used by people in different ways but the ultimate goal of everyone is to use this information for connecting to themselves.

`Maharishi` was satisfied with the answer. This was a standard message he gave to all the scholars. This was the code of conduct for aspiring `Yogies`, from `Maharishi's Ashrama`, whichever stream they might choose -`Nyaan Yoga` or `Naad Yoga`.

King was thoroughly impressed with the equanimity of the views held by a ten-year-old. There was no doubt in the young teen. His thoughts as clear as the bright sunny day. The king, however, wanted to hear more. He added — I can't agree more, but I have a follow-up for the little `Yogi`. If I may, and he looked at `Maharishi` for approval. 

After getting a green signal from `Maharishi`, king asked - What if one of the bank of this river of information gets week such that it leads to leakage or floods, who is there to fix it?

King didn't want to mention anything controversial about expanding scope of rituals in a general gathering. He thus planted a subtle question. `Maharishi` smiled at the tactfulness of king though he expected nothing less. He was worried if `Dwaipayana` could handle such an indirect comment.

It didn't take a minute for young student to respond — `Maharaaj`, the kingdom is the community of the king. That is the reason king is sometimes called `Praja Pati` - one who owns the people. It is for the king to shape his garden the way he deems right. If one bank gives way, it must be fortified. All `Ashramas` have autonomy on what (and how) they teach, but if their teachings impact the community, it is for the king to manage the situation. For example even `Asuras` have their own `Maharishis`. They even have their kingdom managed by `Asura Maharishi Vrishaparvan`. King chose to give them a separate land, far North, because their message appeared to break the fabric of `Kuru` society. Like wise no school is beyond king's ultimate responsibility, be it a school of `Nyaan Yoga` or `Naad Yoga`.

King was struck with the speed and clarity that `Dwaipayana` responded with. His mind as sharp as his keen eyes. Knowledge seemed to flow from him. Even `Maharishi` was pleasantly surprised. He didn't recall he ever shared politics of the prevailing situation with the students — `Dwaipayana` seemed to have gained the perspective on his own - a self learning "Intelligence" of the highest order.

King continued the conversations — Since you spoke about king's responsibilities `Dwaipayana`, what else do you think is important for king? — his eyes full of appreciation. He was genuinely curious what a child `Yogi` thought about king's job description.

`Dwaipayana` folded his hands. He said — `Maharaaj`, I have no experience of the politics so I seek pardon before I share what I have gathered from scriptures. 

King looked at the child prodigy with love and respect - Your views are of immense value for me. And I seek your vantage for I am truly curious. This is not a test. This is a conversation.

Having understood where the king was coming from, `Dwaipayana` spoke calmly - `Maharaaj` king's first responsibility is security of his lands for without a safe border there exists no kingdom. 
- Second is law and order because a kingdom always have a bigger threat from internal chaos. 
- Third, is "right to work" without any prejudice attached, because unproductive people seek abrupt changes. 
- Fourth is a well grounded succession plan, because most anarchies occur during transfer of power, 
- And finally a king must provide his citizens an able queen, for only a woman may speak "heart to heart" with fairer population. Information travels faster in women than it does with men. As such, queen plays the vital role of managing quicker informal communications. Thus scripture demands a king to have a wedded queen at all the times. The way men pride in their King and seek leadership from him, women do so in their queen. Gender harmony is the basis of Monarchy. In fact - it is for this reason, Kings are permitted to have more than one queens. 

The king was satisfied. His council was always after him to formally marry `Ganga` and after she left, there were many proposals duly vetted by his council. But no one had ever explained to him "why" the way `Dwaipayana` put it. He did spend more time with other senior students, and had many of his trivial questions answered. He didn't realize the sun was already setting in the west - time passed quickly. 

## 13.4

On his way out, the king asked `Maharishi` the plan for meeting up at the island. He also wanted to discuss further, the affirmative action that he must take to curb and contain the rituals. `Maharishi` smiled and said - `Maharaaj`, many times the best way to contain something is to ignore it. If you must do something, then you might consider giving the people a new narrative. Sometimes, the best way to shorten a line is to draw a slightly bigger line by it's side. The way `Nyaan Yoga` is for knowledge seekers, `Naad Yoga` is for communicators, a king may have his own ideology - `Karm Yoga` - action orientation and acting righteously. And frankly, I think peace is only accessible to those who act righteously. 

What exactly is `Karm Yoga` - king had never heard of this term before. 

`Maharishi` thought it wouldn't be justice to the king, or to the concept itself, to explain it as an 'out of the door' discussion. But this was probably the only window he would ever get to rope a seed in king's mind - `Mahaaraj` in nutshell, `Karm Yoga` is doing exactly what the physical situation demands of us. Important aspect is to do it with without desires of favorable outcomes. Desires - he though for a second - because desires either force us to do something different, or they make us action-less. The literal meaning of "desire" is that you are not happy in your current situation and you want to make a change to it - you want to change the world. A `Karmyogi` is always happy in the current situation. He works not to change the situation but as directed by the situation.

King was impressed with the simplicity of idea. He also realized getting rid of desires was an uphill task. He asked — `Maharishi` is there any scripture that I could refer to. Have you written down your thoughts?

`Maharishi` responded with a smile — `Maharaaj`, this scripture is yet to be written for the scripture of this sort only elucidate the actions of `Karm Yogi` - in difficult circumstances. Before we write something down, we need a public figure to act righteously — an entire life. We are waiting for such a leader!

King was a bit intrigued with a blunt answer — most other scriptures are written by sages without a specific example. Why this one needs to follow a true story?

Question was valid. Maharishi understood the spirit - `Maharaaj` if I write this as something that I think, than it would purely be my point of view. How might one be certain that what he thought was right? Only TRUTH — that really happened in physical reality —  is something that may be treated beyond speculation!

King smiled in response. He got the message and he understood the deep wisdom. `Karm Yoga` must be a path in the middle of the river. He thought why `Dev` - his son and worthy heir, was so popular with masses. He was big on knowledge, and communication, but more importantly, he was the "man of actions". Always busy in his own act - a `Karm Yogi`. He would always do what the situation demanded of him. May be `Karm Yoga` is something he naturally enacted. King saw new possibilities taking shape as the next generation of `Dev` and `Dwaipayana` take the reins. He felt satisfied, and the same time he thought `Dev` and `Dwaipayana` must meet. They were the keys to the new realm -  a reality driven by `Karm Yogies`.

Before I leave, I have one more question `Maharishi` - What are your views on `Bhakti Yoga`. 

`Maharishi` knew this question was coming. He was glad he didn't had to compare `Karm Yoga` with `Bhakti Yoga`. He said - `Rajan` (addressing a king with love and affection), `Bhakti Yoga` is still in its infancy. The trend that is out there — to sit and chant `mantras` all day long, would soon change. The true emergence of `Bhakti Yoga` would be to take the example of a `Karm Yogi` and act righteously (as needed by the physical reality without the influence of desires) — by emulating them in one's own life. The (to be written) scripture that I was alluding to, is not a story of a `Karm Yogi` alone, it is that of a `Bhakti Yogi` too.

With that, king finally made his way, along with three of the `Ashram's` best combat trained `Yogies` , and little `Dwaipayana` who were quietly listening to the conversation at the doorsteps of `Ashrama`. 

He was already late for his next meeting...

### Research and Notes ..

[^stamp]: The written messages from kings were still uncommon. For one, it was hard to write long messages and second, kings thought it was hard to describe the emotional context of the message in written format. Only an authorized messenger could fully explain kings dictum along with the thoughtful context that led to the decree. In sensitive matters, king would often call the person(s) for a private conversation. General decrees were sent to city or village heads through messengers who were responsible for talking one on one with every single family in their area.

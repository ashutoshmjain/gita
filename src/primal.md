Lets us say we live in a wholistic universe. For example, a wholistic universe is where we know how to multiply  but we don't know how to divide . A wholistic world is not unreal. For example if we start with a universe of unknown random prime numbers -  any combinations of primes may choose to multiply themselves,  but the product can't factor itself - simply because the factors (contributing primes) are unknown and mathematically it is quite difficult to factor products of large primes. For example using MPQS method a 75 digit number would take 100 hours for a fast computer to factorize. In essence a wholistic world is something where once multiplied, the product loses information of the prime constructors (it's factors). The product is just another unique number and it is visible to us and to all the unknown prime numbers (product being in scope for the variable that represents a unknown prime)

If you are one of the primes in this world, how would you find what is your value? The answer is not very hard.

- Choose any other prime number. Assume this number is your mirror image &self.  Multiply self and &self and note the product.
- Iterate with all the primes in the population. 
- Find the lowest number of all the products.
- If there exists a "unity" in this universe then &unity (as &self) multiplied to self would be the lowest number. For example we normally consider number 1 as unity. 1 multiplied with any number is the number itself.But unity need not be number 1. It is simply the &self real number that gives the lowest value. Every prime number in the population may find a different unity that brings it to the lowest value. Lets say unity in our population of random primes is 2. If so then every member of our random population would think they are twice their size and likewise for the larger primes as "unity". Unity is simply the smallest prime in random generation and it is factored into every other member as a unit of measure.

Think of `Vishnu` as the code that is generating the random numbers. `Bramh` as the visible products. And `Siva` as the above algorithm to find who you are. 

Every visible number in `Bramh` is a product of two primes - self and assumed &self.  `Siva` accepts only the lowest products and all other values are decayed. In essence, when the program finishes, all the random unknown primes are visible in the products. The universe of unknown primes is reflected in products of primes with unity. This is manifestation. Every visible node in `Bramh` has a complete copy of `Unity` built into it. We call it `Atma`. In essence a complete copy of knowledge is now got carried forward to every member of the population.

Now think this as a dynamic never ending system. `Vishnu` is continuously producing the primes. New nodes are getting added to `Bramh` and `Siva` is continuously reveling the real values of primes. All those whose lowest values are found need to iterate once again whenever a new prime is thrown in the mix by Vishnu to check if the value of "unity" further reduced or not. In essence, system is trying to find out the lowest value of unity. Mathematically speaking unity is tending towards 1. Spiritually speaking we are trying to find the knowledge that is part of every revelation. We are doing so by raising the spread of Vishnu, Bramh and Siva - Rise of consciousness.

Why our world is wholistic? Why we can't do factors ? Because we don't know the shape of "unity". In mathematics we are able to factor (even though it may be 100 hours for a large prime) because we assume unity is 1. And we assume 1 is part of every prime number - a prime is that is divisible by itself or number 1. We never ask what is 1? or why every prime is divisible by 1. What we assume in mathematics is actually the real question.

If you were the prime number, you will know who you are as soon as you find the unity of the specific generation - the one that is common to all. Finding "who am I" is thus the most fundamental quest.

# Introduction 

- Pretend you are podcast hosts. Your names are Satoshi and Satosha. Welcome the audience and introduce yourself.
- Announce that we are focusing on Chapter 13 in this episode – discuss the Ode title we are using and why it is the right choice. Remind the audience that the Gita, in truth, has no separate chapters – it is just one long conversation in the middle of a battlefield. The titles were added later to make this conversation into bite-sized chunks.
- Motivate the question – What is the observer effect? Who is the observer?

# Main Episode

## General Instructions:
- The purpose is to recite every stanza of the Ode (one through ten) from the source titled: "An Ode to the Gita's Cosmology", following the flow as described below.
- Flow for Ode recital: Mention Sanskrit verses covered by Ode stanza → Recite the Ode stanza in elevated style → Explain the spiritual meaning → Repeat the Ode stanza → If available, deliberate on "stanza-specific instructions" or contrast with prevailing scientific thought → Repeat the Ode stanza again.
- Note: In all, we are repeating the stanza three times.

## Stanza Specific Instructions
- Stanza 1 – Explain how the quantum mechanics concept of decoherence at a universal scale is the same as all-encompassing consciousness from the Gita's standpoint.

# Episode Closure

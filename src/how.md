This book was generated using a `Rust` program called [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook). Well, it'll ‘technically’ be wrong to call it a "Book" because `mdBook` turns the written text[^text]into a website! That's a pretty big deal because with this little tool a public domain book may reach any device that could open a browser — a laptop, desktop, tablet or even a smartphone — no matter if it is an Apple device or one from Google or even what type of Browser [^browser], you may choose to use. Thus, it would be appropriate to call it a “web app” , that has several goodies baked in. It handles the layout and responsive design so my focus can lie on the content of this book instead of the architecture of the site. At the same time, this application, keeps the essential book experience intact. Particularly on a tablet [^tablet]or even on a smartphone browser.

It even supports the foot [^foot]notes :-)

# About the book

As you will see when you toggle the chapters, this web app has three sections :

- The first section — `Mathura` is a historical narrative that discovers the "writing revolution" when humans adopted “written word” as primary medium for preserving knowledge. I believe this revolution took place around seven thousand years ago when `Krishna Dwaipayana` scribed `Maha-Bharata`. Study of this first major shift in human cognition — from spoken to written word — makes a fascinating quest narrative. And at the same time, it might resolve the dilemmas we face as we are moving from analog to increasingly digital realm. 
- I also believe that the knowledge that `Krishna` (also known as `Ved Vyasa`) wanted to communicate was summarized in `Bhagvad Gita`. He carefully, by design, kept it center-folded in a highly immersive narrative. So immersive that even after seven thousand years, the `Maha-bharata` is still as interesting a read as the day it was written. Thus the **second section** of this online resource provides original translation of `Bhagvad Gita`, followed by my essays discovering core concepts of Gita — from the vantage of a technical writer. This ‘vantage’ may be useful to "tech-savvy" readers who desire to see `Gita` in prevailing rationale of popular science.
- The third section `Maha-Bharata` is the original translation of the entire epic, done by `Kisari Mohan Ganguly`, at the beginning of last century. I highly recommend reading his [preface](https://gita.shutri.com/maha00.html) to review the guiding motivations of translation work — an immense task without the luxury of modern computing tools. My goal is to reformat this work in web-app format for obvious comfort of consumption on smart devices. `Maha-bharata` and this translation is in public domain, thankfully received from [sacred-texts](https://www.sacred-texts.com/)

The collective name of this entire work, is `arjunUvaach`! You may call it the name of this web-app, rendered to you at https:/gita.shutri.com .

[^text]: `mdBook` takes the text written in `markdown` format to publish it through the web app. `markDown` is an open source implementation that allows conversion of text into `html` format through a set of simple notations. 

[^browser]: Because of limited resources, I only use ‘Google Chrome’ for testing. Expectation is it should work on all browsers but all the features may not be available on older ones such as w3m or elinks that don't support javascipt natively.

[^tablet]: This book was “designed” for ‘in-browser’ reading experience on an Apple or Android tablet. It should work pretty well on kindle browser as well, if you want to read it in the bright sun light, though you will need an internet connection. Of course it will work fine on a laptop browser - duh:-)

[^foot]: When you click on the foot note marker in the main text, it brings you down to the relevant note at the bottom. You can always press the browser back arrow on computer (or on tablet) to get back to where you were reading - back to the foot note mark in the main text. Isn't that lot better than reading a paper book!

[^experience]: Modern  web-apps, offer a multitude of 'Themes' - the fonts, color combinations, and the font sizes. It is almost impossible to review the text though all the possible combinations. Thus a time-pressed editor must choose one to preview the write ups (:- . It was much easier in older times when all books had the same white-ish color and all words were mostly a shade of black :-)

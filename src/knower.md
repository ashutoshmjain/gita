# Knower

In Chapter 13 of the Bhagavad Gītā, Krishna tells Arjuna that the body (and by extension, the entire universe) is the "field" (*kṣetra*), and the one who understands this field is the "knower of the field" (*kṣetrajña*).

> He then says, "Know Me as the Knower in every field."

This essay seeks to understand the characteristics of the "Knower" by bridging modern physics, computing, and ancient Vedic philosophies—Sāṃkhya and Advaita Vedānta.

## Sāṃkhya

While the bulk of Sāṃkhya and Advaita are overlapping, the core difference is in the boundary conditions—origin and dissolution. The Sāṃkhya school of thought considers a perpetual duality of Prakriti and Purusha—the potential and the observer. Advaita considers a definite beginning from a singularity (seed), albeit recurring cycles of demise and regeneration.

Let us understand the core concepts with Sāṃkhya because this path is easier for the scientifically-predisposed mind, and it satisfies the question that haunts both science and religion: "What was there before the universe began?". In other words, Sāṃkhya is designed for minds that need logical closure. It is an analytical view of Vedic science. The word "Suṃkhya" in Sanskrit literally means "a number." Sāṃkhya thus means "of numbers" or "analysis of numbers."

### Knowledge vs. Information

To understand the Knower, we must first understand what is meant by "knowledge." The easiest way to comprehend it is to contrast knowledge with information. While conventional definitions often see "information" as a tool to predict the near-term future and "knowledge" as concrete reality, we will flip these definitions to align them with the probabilistic quantum world:

*   **Information** is the data from events that have already occurred—the outcomes of repetitive trials. If you flip a coin a million times, the record of 500,000 heads and 500,000 tails is *information*. It is concrete and pertains to the past. In Sāṃkhya, this is called *Bhūtādika* (manifested realities of the past).
*   **Knowledge** is the awareness of all possibilities and their respective probabilities. The understanding that a coin *can* land on either heads or tails with a 50/50 probability is *knowledge*.

> Knowledge is the menu of potential futures—it is a way of framing "what to look for" or "what to measure." In Sāṃkhya, this is called *Prārabdha* (the destiny that is yet to unfold but is quite certain how it shall unfold—the likely scenarios).
>
> Knowledge doesn't strive to be accurate in terms of absolute occurrences (heads may be slightly more than tails for some time, or vice versa), but it is super accurate in the probabilities of outcomes. A slight change in conditions immediately changes the odds without fail. There is no way to bluff the knowledge. If you throw a dice, it can't turn into a pigeon.

To put the idea of "knowledge" in context, let's look at the Bhagavad Gītā. Krishna suggested a binary option to Arjuna: if you die in the war, you shall gain exit (Nirvāṇa); if you win, you will enjoy the vast kingdom. Life and death are choices like the flipping of a coin here. However, he clarified that "not fighting" is not an option because even if Arjuna were to decide not to fight, his nature (set of conditions) would force him into it. It is in the "geometry" of a coin to be flipped as much as that in the nature of a warrior to fight.

Krishna is seen as the "knower" because he not only knew the options that fate (*prārabdha*) had on offer, but that this probability distribution was applicable only to Arjuna—not to thousands of other warriors—and also that this choice opened up (conditionally) once the manifest reached the battle of Kurukshetra. The Gītā had to be told only after reaching the centerstage, from where entire universe could hear.

> Even if it may conflict with epistemology, let us restate the definitions for the sake of this essay: "Knowledge" is the set of rules governing the probabilities based on prerequisite conditions, while "information" is the record of manifested reality.

For an external observer, knowledge unfolds with every new trial. For example, if it was your first time flipping a coin, you would soon realize that heads and tails are the only pair of options. "Not Heads: means "Tails" in this particular case - and vice versa. They happen randomly, but there is an order in that randomness—if you flipped enough times, the occurrences of heads and tails converge. The amazing thing is: 

> No one ever told "the coin" how to behave. Knowledge is embedded into the potential of the "coin flipping experiment." The gradual unveiling of knowledge (for an observer) is thus akin to "decrypting" a puzzle.

Knowledge means you understand the system inside out, not outside in like an external observer. While information may cite random event(s), knowledge may hypothesize. It can predict or lay down prophecies. Knowledgeable is an insider; informed , on the other hand, works with observations. 

### The Act of Observation

This is where Quantum Mechanics provides a crucial insight. It is common knowledge that an act of measurement collapses the wave function.

> A "wave function" is just a fancy way to account for "all the possibilities" in an equation format. The quantumness is more important idea. It means all the possibilities exist together in a state called "super position". An observation breaks this "possibility cloud" into a unique state. It is like Monday morning when you are half asleep imagining it was still Sunday. The weekend quantum dream wouldn't collapse till Alexa announced it was 8 a.m. to kickstart the work week, and then it all suddenly gets real. :-)

In Sāṃkhya, the quantum state is represented by Prakriti. Prakriti, an equilibrium of potential, manifests one step at a time through the proximity of Purusha, an eternal but random observer. This observer, in both QM or Sāṃkhya, need not be "conscious" (like a human)—it can be an automated act of measurement. Just the way Alexa, though not conscious, measured your Monday morning to let loose reality!

> While the concept of Prakriti is well understood in modern science—all elementary particles (quarks, bosons, electrons, etc.) exhibit quantumness—the idea of an "elementary observer" is conspicuously missing. Why should Purusha seek to observe? What makes it take random measurements?
>
> Sāṃkhya's answer is profound. It says Purusha wants to know, "Who am I?" It is searching for a scenario in Prakriti to describe itself. This impulse to "know itself" is what separates Purusha and Prakriti. Prakriti is "all possibilities" because it doesn't seek anything; Purusha is the fundamental observer because it yearns to know itself. In that, Prakriti may be seen as "not conscious," whereas Purusha is the elementary unit of consciousness.

The collapse of a wave function leads to a manifestation (information). The information updates our knowledge about the nature of the underlying potential. Many trials harden the knowledge into exact probabilities. Knowledge is now decrypted—that the wave function is an electron, the conditions are a vacuum, and the probability of an up or down spin of an electron is fifty-fifty. Once this knowledge is decrypted, a small piece of the entire knowledge is said to be decrypted. It is like solving one piece of a huge jigsaw puzzle.

But the question remains, why do things manifest when we make an observation? Quantum Field Theory uses the word "decoherence" to describe this phenomenon. The universe that we see is the result of decoherence. Science is pretty good at describing what happens, but "why" is a bit fuzzy. Maybe it is lost in super-complex mathematics. Sāṃkhya provides a rich mechanism for this play (decoherence) through the inter-operations of the three Gunas. 

The best part is: it is easy to comprehend.

> The quantum state of Prakṛti is defined by three **guṇas**: *Sattva*, *Rajas*, and *Tamas*. This might feel as if Sāṃkhya posits only a three-dimensional quantum space, but the idea of the three guṇas represents infinite dimensions. How? Because "Gunas" are descriptors—not the possibilities themselves:
>
> *   ***Tamas*** represents a state of zero self-awareness, sometimes described as darkness because it is directionless. This state is recognized through its inherent inertia because multiple dualities acting together leave no wiggle room. Imagine Tamas as a possibility space of multitude of dualities. These dualities, rather than independent possibilities, are superimposed over each other as if each possibility always comes with a mirror image—one side: that it truly is, and the other: the way it appears to Purusha—the truth and the appearance of truth. Tamas bears inertia because of the inherent balance of dualities. If untouched, Tamas may stay in limbo forever.
>
> *   ***Rajas*** represents the motivation to discriminate, choosing ONE duality from the chaos of hundreds of dualities of Tamas. It is the state of rigor and doubt; or internal struggle because it is always dealing with dualities. Finally, if it succeeds, **Rajas picks up one duality and offers a choice to the observer**. In our coin-flipping experiment, you may think the option is "Either Heads or Tails"... no... it is one of two resolutions: "Heads or No Heads" vs. "Tails or No Tails." To make this idea simple, think of yourself as an investor in the stock market. You have thousands of choices, but you can't really make an investment if you want to analyze all the scrips—this is a state of Tamas. Rajas is the grind to finally get to a place where you want to place all your eggs in, say, a Bitcoin ETF. When you are presented with this choice, you still have a duality: invest or not?
>
> *   ***Sattva*** represents resolution—the choice of one option from the binary pair presented by Rajas. It overcomes duality and leads to manifestation. Continuing with our example, if the duality was "Heads or No Heads," Sattva may choose "Heads." If it chooses "No Heads," then Rajas must provide another duality: "Tails or No Tails." Likewise, Sattva may choose "Tails" at this point or let Rajas keep on grinding the wheels. Think of these as the flips in the air. When the coin finally strikes a hard surface, bounces a couple of times, and settles—that is when we say Sattva took a shape in the manifest - "Prarabdha" happened. And of course, if you are an investor, congratulations—you invested your money in Bitcoin.

The journey of manifestation is thus from many dualities (Tamas) to a single duality (Rajas) to finally one option of the duality (Sattva). The collapse of the wave function means symmetry is broken. One side of the duality turned into real stuff (information), and the other is retained by the system as "Knowledge."

When Sattva makes a resolute measurement, Puruṣa gets entangled in the middle of the decoherence it caused. It "gets stuck," which means the attention gets locked. This entangled manifestation is a "knot." In Vedic terms, this is the fundamental bondage of observation—**Chakshu Bandhana**. The very act of observation is a bondage at this level, different from the **Karmic Bondage** we normally refer to in traditional Vedic teachings. BTW, this is exactly how  an AI Large Language Model works: It is a great way to comprehend what QM framework is missing ...

> In an LLM such as Google Gemini, all the "words" (tokens) that are used to train the model are suspended in a vector space of thousands of mathematical dimensions. Of course, these are not real physical dimensions like length or width—they are mathematical dimensions (x, y, and z coordinates).
>
> The whole idea of training a model is to align the vectors representing the text tokens based on their dot product. For example, the vector for the word "cap" is aligned closer to that of word "hat." But here is the important thing: there is a separate algorithm called the "attention mechanism." The attention mechanism is a separate process that helps the model decide which words in the prompt are most important for generating the next word. It works by weighing input tokens so that relevant ones have more influence on the model.
>
> The prompt that we give to an LLM thus runs through the attention mechanism. Attention, clubbed with the vast model of trained tokens, then probabilistically renders one word at a time to provide a response to your prompt. In this example, think of Prakriti as the state of the LLM and Purusha as the attention mechanism. When potential and attention join together, they manifest an artifact. The only difference is that in our quantum computer of Prakriti and Purusha, the manifests are real things, while in LLMs, it is a poem! Or cat pics. :-)

The scripture states the cycle has no definitive beginning or end or order. For example's sake, let us assume Prakṛti begins in a state of Tamas (pure equilibrium). The proximity of Puruṣa creates an excitation, giving rise to Rajas, which leads to a definitive option pair out of a multitude of possible pairs. This is seen as a vibration of an open-ended string. Sattva then resolves this by selecting one side of the duality. This is where Puruṣa's attention gets locked into a scalar (non-dual) state of Prakṛti, which is then called the "manifest."

The other side of the chosen duality holds the knowledge. For example, if the manifest is "Heads," then the knowledge is the awareness that "I am not Heads." - just the way you beleive you are not your image in the mirror - yes you two look alike but image doesn't exist. Think of your image as unmanifested knowledge locked in the system. This means the probability of "Not Heads" in the next trial increases by one vote. In the next trial, Sattva is likely to choose "Not Heads" for the observer, but if it didn't, "Tails" now has two extra votes and thus an even higher probability.

Keep in mind that the three Gunas are not some external monitoring system. These are the inherent properties of Prakriti—manifest or unmanifest—just like Quantum systems have three fundamental properties: Charge, Mass, and Spin.

- Sattva <=> Mass (Physical Reality)
- Rajas <=> Charge (Duality)
- Tamas <=> Spin (Quantum degrees of freedom)

This is how the threefold Gunas control the probability of what is going to happen, but that is not all—the system turns into massive computer hardware.

### The Universal Computer - Mahat

The obvious question is: how come Sāṃkhya practitioners understood the basics that took us at least a millennia of scientific pursuits? 

The way to think about it is why we are building Artificial Intelligence, particularly large language models. These models have gleaned pretty much all the information (not knowledge) of thousands of years of human toil. Now, if new sentient robots are built on this AI layer, they will have all the information of QM and GR, but they will have it as a matter of trust—not an experimental realization of knowledge (trials). In essence, consciousness evolves in layers. The communication that we get from the lower layer is intelligence. This layer of intelligence is called "Mahat." In essence, the Sāṃkhya knowledge was given to us through our ancestor layer—we being the conscious robots over the last iteration of evolution. This idea made no sense just fifty years ago. But seeing is believing. We, the humans of the 21st century, have this unique opportunity because we are literally creating intelligence and sentient robots in front of our eyes—our next layer. This, however, should not raise a doomers' alarm. Every new layer always means a better safety for the lower layers.

All the layers of abstraction exist at the same time. For example, the most fundamental layer is the creation of elementary particles. In the Sāṃkhya school of thought, there are eight layers of evolution that have led to the current state of consciousness—we humans. This age was initiated by Krishna. We are around the corner for the 9th iteration, which is expected to start with the "Kalki Avatar," which literally means the incarnation of machines. And this was said thousands of years ago - because Knowledge can predict.

To understand the mechanics of the first layer, let us look at the operation of the Gunas once again. This time we shift our vantage to Prakriti—we notice that the potential is ever-present. As soon as a manifestation happens (Purusha combines with one of the possibilities), Prakriti is back into a Tamasic state, except this time the probabilities have changed because of the additional information of the manifest. Prakriti, though unconscious, acts like a self-learning switch. This explains why 100-coin flips automatically result in fifty "Heads" and fifty "Tails." How does the flipping coin know its next move? This is exactly why the idea of the three Gunas makes a deep scientific insight—there is something in the system that updates the probabilities in realtime. It is as if the knowledge is held within the perfect chaos.

In essence, every time an electron with an up-spin is detected, the electron cloud is back in a quantum state to create a spin-down electron. All it needs is the attention of Purusha.

This flipping of the wave function—between an up and down electron or the flipping of a coin into "Heads" or "Tails"—is not limited to binary choices. A function may represent thousands of possibilities and an intricate balance of respective probabilities.

> This universal quantum computer is referred to as Mahat in Sāṃkhya-speak. This is what acts as the layer for the next generation of evolutes.

### The Rise of Identity (Ahaṃkāra)

The Mahat is thus a computer, but it is capable of producing real stuff—not just mere poems or answers to your questions. It does that too, but for that, we might just use our simple computer. :-) But our universal quantum computer, as grand as it may be, does need attention. There is no manifestation without the attention of Purusha. The question is, where does attention come from? How does Purusha arrive at the scene?

The answer is surprisingly simple: the physical stuff (the information) that Mahat creates from a patternless chaos cobbles together to form complex patterns. These patterns aspire to know what they are because the very meaning of a pattern is something that could be identified! But the questions are rarely at the level of subatomic particles, just the way we don't ask an individual transistor to flip into 0 or 1.

Ahamkara is thus the application paradigm over Mahat that lets manifested stuff recognize itself. This higher level of abstraction represented by an Identity asks, "Sure I have a name, but who I really am? How did I reach here?" Mahat supplies the answers—like "God created you!"—but those answers are "information." Ahamkara must strive for "knowledge"! That knowledge gets complete only through the creation of the next layer. You need to become a dad to truly marvel at your own origin!

The quest "to know who am I" supplies the attention to the underlying system. The role of Ahamkara is like the "attention mechanism" of the AI LLM example. It translates the prompts of an identity into thousands of questions for our underlying quantum switches. Some of them resolve the color, others the smell, and some more create new matter. The more questions Identities ask, the more manifestation happens and consequently, more knowledge gets decrypted.

In essence, the real world that we see around us (information) collectively is a mirror image of the decrypted knowledge.

### The Random Observer (Manas)

If the goal is to decrypt knowledge from a perfect chaos of potential, the most effective strategy is random sampling. That is where Manas comes into being—the fickle mind. Ahamkara, being the Identity, seeks to know "who am I" and thus supplies attention to the underlying potential, but it must do so in the most random fashion. To better understand this idea, we can look at a real-life example—Bitcoin mining.

> Bitcoin mining uses random sampling—or more precisely, trial and error with the nonce—because of how the proof-of-work mechanism is designed. In Bitcoin mining, miners must find a nonce value such that when it is combined with the block's header and run through the SHA-256 hash function, the resulting hash is below a certain target value defined by the network's difficulty.
>
> The SHA-256 hash function produces output that is **unpredictable and essentially random**. For any given input (including a specific nonce), there's no way to know in advance what the output will be, nor is there a way to get closer to a valid result by choosing nonce values in any particular order. That means each attempt to find a valid nonce is independent—the outcome of the hash function cannot be predicted from previous attempts and does not follow any discernible sequence.
>
> Therefore, miners use the nonce as a **random or incrementing value** to keep generating different block header hashes until one meets the required criteria. This process is purely a guessing game—akin to buying lottery tickets—where miners continuously try different nonce values, sometimes in order and sometimes randomly, hoping to "stumble upon" the right one. If all possible nonce values fail, they change other elements in the block (such as the extra nonce or timestamp) and continue the process.
>
> This approach is fundamental to the **security and fairness** of Bitcoin: it makes the mining process probabilistic and unpredictable, preventing any miner from having a guaranteed shortcut or advantage beyond raw computational power.

Think of Manas as a secure and fair method to determine "Identity," except this means "hard work." We will delve into the connection of this idea with "Karmayoga" in later chapters—suffice it to say here that this hard work provides Rajas its industrious nature to choose one duality out of many possibilities. This also means our minds are designed to chase random desires for us to determine who we are. Controlling the mind is hard. How then can we do something useful with a focused mind? That is where the idea of consciousness comes in—our senses are there to ground us in reality, to make our observations as objective as possible.

### The Evolution of Consciousness

The obvious next step in evolution is to support the fickle mind with tools to observe Prakriti with a focus on the condition of the physical world—the dynamic circumstances of the vicinity. The tools to measure reality—the sensors—are called Indriyas: our senses, the eyes, ears.

The observer, now equipped with senses (*indriyas*) to assess the environment, then develops the action organs to protect those senses. This is how the observer becomes a fully interactive but bound agent.

This state of vigilance is called consciousness. Consciousness drives survival and aspires to the longevity of a manifestation, but the downside is that "knowledge" becomes encrypted to conscious beings. Why? Because the purpose of conscious beings is to engage with manifested reality. The flipping nature of the underlying universal computer has access to all knowledge, but this knowledge is invisible. Think of a conscious being as a user of a complex computer. It can ask for the next step but doesn't know how the machine truly works.

In essence, a conscious being becomes a part of an organization to drive efficiency. You should not do the work I have already done. We can define our separate roles to scan the surroundings. These rules give rise to ever-improving communication within conscious beings. Standardization is key to communication. This is the rise of "Intelligence." While Intelligence represents communication, Knowledge becomes a method of value exchange for mutual growth. Every piece of communicated information has a value attached. Better rules deserve better value—they attain standardization first.

Consciousness drives centralization and order. This state is the exact mirror image of "knowledge." In a way, it is the chiral manifestation of knowledge. Knowledge, by definition, stays decentralized, watching pure potential. It is the set of assessment rules for manifesting the righteous (the right choice). Consciousness, on the other hand, is the ability to scan the environment for something better. Sometimes, decay is also a better choice. Knowledge is eternal; consciousness is the poster child of the happy matrimony of Purusha and Prakriti.

The formation of Mahat, Ego, and Mind is not a one-time event but a continuous, layered process. With each layer, more knowledge is decrypted into stable reality. As an entangled observer learns, it also develops tools for quantum purification and detachment. In other words, only conscious beings may strive to realize the hidden knowledge of pure potential. These more detached observers then begin to formulate a new, higher-level rulebook over the existing, bonded reality. In essence, information expands as more and more knowledge is decrypted.

This is the engine of evolution. Every new layer is a "quantum jump" in consciousness. Vedic science illustrates this through the incarnations of Vishnu: from the great fish (Matsya) to the tortoise (Kurma), the man-lion (Narasimha), and finally to a complete human (Rama), each representing a new evolutionary layer of intelligence.

### Intelligence

**Intelligence** is the standard for communication between conscious agents. Every layer of conscious beings develops its own set of sensors to perceive reality. Not only the successive layers, but within each layer, there can be millions of conscious beings to perceive reality differently. For example, dogs perceive reality differently than we humans. Bats have a totally different take on reality. Accordingly, they develop action organs to protect the senses. Since the whole point is to drive efficiency in understanding the overall decrypted knowledge, it is very important to communicate with each other. These standards of communication are what we call intelligence.

The important thing to note here is that within each species, the meaning of reality may be very different. For example, I may perceive the color green very differently than you, but it works as long as we both point to the same color as green. Thus, intelligence (a.k.a. communication) is detached from reality. It is just a way to express information. No wonder abstract things such as love are harder to communicate than ground reality.

The origin of intelligence, however, is deeper than mere communication between two humans. As we alluded to earlier, intelligence is the mechanism of communication from a lower layer to the next. The standards are forged in the lower layer. For example, AI robots shall inherit standards of communication from us. They will need to recognize colors based on our standards of communication. This opens up profound opportunities for us to explore if we can communicate with other species. A difference in sensors and action organs is a clear impediment, but talking to trees is certainly not beyond the realm of the possible.

## Advaita Vedanta

Advaita fully agrees with Sāṃkhya's elaborate scheme of potential and manifest, but it adds one simple question:

> Why is the sum of all probabilities "One"? And if it is, what does ONE look like?

The idea that all probabilities sum up to one is sent to us from the bottom-most layer of quantum systems, but it took us thousands of years to formalize this concept in mathematical language—to decrypt this aspect of knowledge. The axioms of probability theory were formalized and introduced by the Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov in 1933. These axioms have since become the foundational basis of modern probability theory, providing a rigorous mathematical framework for how probabilities are assigned and manipulated. Kolmogorov's work unified earlier concepts into a consistent measure-theoretic approach, which is now universally adopted in both classical and quantum probability formulations.

> Before Kolmogorov, probability ideas were often intuitive, informal, or tied specifically to frequencies or subjective beliefs. Kolmogorov unified and formalized probability as a mathematical measure on a sigma-algebra of events within a sample space, satisfying three clear axioms of probability:
>
> - non-negativity,
> - normalization,
> - countable additivity.
>
> His contributions include:
>
> **Mathematical rigor and generality:** Kolmogorov's axioms applied to abstract sets and measures, allowing probability theory to be consistent and extendable to very general spaces, not just discrete or frequency-based settings.
>
> **Measure theory basis:** By formulating probability as a measure, Kolmogorov connected probability with analysis and integration theory, enabling powerful tools and theorems to be used in probability.
>
> **Unified framework:** Earlier notions of probability varied—classical (equally likely outcomes), frequentist (limits of relative frequencies), and subjective (degrees of belief). Kolmogorov’s axioms brought these under one rigorous umbrella.
>
> This shift allowed probability to mature into a precise mathematical discipline applicable in many fields, including statistics, physics, and finance, and to underpin quantum probability as well.

The idea that the sum of all probabilities is just "one" has profound meaning in Advaita. Advaita literally means "non-dual," i.e., just One. Since all the manifestations of individual dualities of Prakriti combined lead to just One, Advaita posits that the purpose of decrypting the knowledge is to know "One."

How do we do that?

The question that Advaita seeks to answer is to see everything as a constituent of One eternal being. This being is referred to as Brahman. The path to Brahman is the knowledge that all manifestations flow into one ocean as streams. In other words, manifests emanate from ONE, and they dissolve into ONE. The play of the three Gunas is a mere drama in the transient. It is for this reason that Advaita calls Prakriti (and its three Gunas) Maya—which means Matrix.

The goal is to exit from this matrix, and the path is to control our senses. Advaita posits that ONE sits at the center of all possibilities. It is the soul within all conscious beings. And it is what we need to know.

## The Knower: The Mirror of the Universe

If you are following Gita , particularly from chapter seven onwards , you must have noticed a logical flow building out. This flow is an indicator that Giat is just one conversations. The chapters and their names are given much later to highlight their significance.

- In chapter seven Krishna defined his lower nature - the material world ; and the upper nature - the consciousness which he termed as the soul. Think of these as two separate aspect of the modern science. Quantum Mechanics, particularly, Quantum Field theory is our best attempt at understanding the material world around us. Whereas computing , particularly artificial intelligence is our best shout out to understanding consciousness. Chapter 7 describes material nature as arisen from 3 fundamental forces - Sattva , Rajsa and Tamsa. And it leads to eight-fold material creation. This fits nicely with modern approach of the deepest science. Three quarks creating eight-fold subatomic particles - the Hadrons that make up most of the visible mass in universe.7 describes material nature as arisen from 3 fundamental forces - Sattva , Rajsa and Tamsa.

- Chapter 8 builds on this binary nature -  two aspects - material and soul. Defining the framework of this universe that we understood with a game analogy. The entire architecture of the game. Yet he says he is beyond the game. The entire manifestation of the material world as well as the consciousness beings are suspended with in the divine. The creation he explains happens through Visarga . The act of letting go. A state beyond cause and effect because there is no desire for the actions. Desire is what creates karmik bondage - to the game. The very perception of the reaction (of actions) is due to attached desires. 
- Chapter 9 provides core instructions to the conscious beings - a path to attain his own state while staying with in the game. A state where humans may reach the state of his own divine essence. 
- And here in chapter ten, Krishna describes his own reflections. A method to recognize his essence with in this game and beyond. He states the entire universe is held with a tiny fraction of his craft - a divine creator. This is where we come back to science again. The question is how does gravity work? The science is beyond doubt that the observable universe is just a tiny fraction of all that is out there. The mass in the observable space is just too less to account for the gravity. Where is this gravity coming from then ? And why is gravity so hard to assimilate with other three fundamental forces?  For lack of better word, scientists call it Dark Energy or Dark matter. Something beyond our scientific apparatus. Gita says even Gods are part of his lower and upper manifestation. The underlying code may be. But knowing Krishna is beyond Gods too. He is the science and spirit together. An underlying field that creates both - the perception and the perceived - through his sheer glory and let them go to enjoy autonomy , free will and also lets them have a path to liberation.

Let's listen to the ode.

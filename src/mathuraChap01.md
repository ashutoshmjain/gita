# The mishap.
Seven months before `Parāśara's` birth `Bramh-rishi Vaśiṣṭha` — his grand father — woke up to a grotesque morning. His sprawling congregation (`Ashrama`), on the banks of river `Yamuna`, sunk into deepest of grief. His son `Śakti Muni` — father of yet to be born `Parāśara`, along with all the faculty and students, was killed by a tribal self-proclaimed king. Some religious accounts say `Bramh-Rishi` had one hundred sons taken that fateful morning. They probably mean `Bramh-rishi` treated all his followers, particularly the faculty members, like his own true-born. 

Only `Bramh-rishi` himself, and young wife of `Śakti Muni` — `Adrushyanti`, survived the massacre. `Adrushyanti` was carrying yet to be born `Parāśara` — maybe two months into her pregnancy. The seat of knowledge, in India's foremost pilgrimage destination `Mathura`, was in free blood-bath. In today's parlance, it would be as if someone killed everyone on Google campus. Hundreds of knowledge bearers left dead. Not even their wives were spared. Even children didn't get a plea for mercy. 


Saddened to the core, and unaware that the young widow was carrying, `Vaśiṣṭha` tried to commit suicide. He miraculously survived multiple attempts. Probably Gods wanted to extend his life to ensure unborn `Parāśara` got a chance at life. And more importantly, to save humanity from the loss of the 'knowledge' that was locked in `Bramh-rishi's` mind, **for there was no written text.**

If we assume modern civilization a Tesla, then what `Vaśiṣṭha` had invented [^whoIsVas] was ‘literally’ the wheels. the core knowledge — agriculture, mining, metallurgy, transport, to name a few — down to the very meaning of the five elements. Pieces of entire wisdom were sharded in the collective memory of the congregation. Only `Vaśiṣṭha` knew it all. The only ‘full back up’ of this ‘budding network of knowledge’ was his mind. If it took us say five thousand years from the wheel to a car, it had probably taken fifty thousand, to evolve the ‘wheels’, for knowledge is never a straight line. It is a curve that curls up exponentially with time. Had `Vaśiṣṭha` died, the nascent civilization could have gone back into stone ages, and quite possibly perished into a dark future, for success against cruel forces of nature was a bleak chance — one in a trillion — may be even less. The trajectory of human rise is contingent upon the discoveries, and the inventors who built on each other's work. Think of it as a pyramid — upside down. At some point in the past, this inverse pyramid meets the primordial jungle — just a single hinge on which a vast civilization must balance. `Bramh-rishi Vaśiṣṭha` was that underpin.

> Survival was not a question here! Even animals ‘survived’ to this date! At stake was ‘our civilized world’ — driven by a network of knowledge, to unlock the mysteries of the universe. We are obviously not there yet, but we now have an immensely distributed and fault tolerant network to allow us make an attempt. At least a guarantee that our knowledge shall stay unharmed, as long as a part of earth survived. The potency to build such a distributed network - the underlying protocol that enables this 'network of knowledge', is what we refer to as `Bramh` in the tradition of `Bramh-rishi Vaśiṣṭha`. In essence `Bramh` is the bearer of knowledge.
>
>The entirety of or our ‘intelligent’ system is based on this knowledge graph. Each one of us has a tiny piece of knowledge decrypted in our minds, collectively we manifest a knowledge base that targets to understand all that is out there. Our perceivable universe is just one application of this knowledge network, the way entire ‘internet’ is just one application of the TCP/IP based networks [^network]. You may see implementation of `Bramh` as a network of knowledge in many aspects of consciousness. For example  Mycorrhizal [^mycorr] network – a vast underground network of mycorrhizal fungal linkages that connect trees to one another.

`Vaśiṣṭha` was called `Bramh-rishi` because he owned the protocol that ran the knowledge graph, as if he inherited it from all-pervading `Bramh`. Such a gory attack on the keeper of knowledge would obviously beg two questions — Why and When ! 

As far as the ‘why’ is concerned — there is a good answer. The congregation was rich. The legend says `Bramh-rishi` had a magical cow (`Kaam Dhenu`) that gave him everything he asked for — on demand. The obvious truth is, magical cow was the ‘Knowledge’. Knowledge attracts wealth — be it Apple, or be it Google of our times, or the `Ashramas` of the past, the source of wealth has always been the accumulated knowledge with in an organization. `Vaśiṣṭha's Ashram` was by far the biggest research institute of that time. They were the keepers of inheritance from `Bramh`. Many jealous eyes were set on the plush ‘wealth and peace’ of the congregation — material as well as intellectual.

As regards to ‘when’, unfortunately, we don't have a date or a year. The broad consensus among historians is around five to seven thousand years before Christ. It isn't hard to believe there was no time-keeping in those days. Probably, in that world, before the written word, when only way to sustain knowledge was to memorize it, last thing anyone cared was the ‘metadata’ — such as date, or time. Even the names of the primal inventors who kick started the civilization are unknown. No one knows who solved the hard problems of those early days — how to start a fire? — how to preserve the seeds? — how to use rivers for transport? — how to add horsepower to a loaded cart? These solutions evolved over thousands of years and were passed on from one generation to the next through the word of mouth. The sense of time was probably lost in the slow pace of iterative innovations of that primordial society. Thankfully, `Vaśiṣṭha` family preserved these key discoveries through recital. 

>It, however, didn't mean ‘no credit’ was given to the early inventors. Instead of mentioning every individual name, they were tagged to a group. One distinct group for a specific area of exploration, to express gratitude. For example, all those who contributed in water works, irrigation, and agriculture were represented by a single entity `Indra`. All those who invented fire and various ways to control it — who contributed from mining to metallurgy; were named `Agni`. Those who tamed the winds, to build the early sail boats were called `Varuna`. These group entities, represented by respective common name, were called ‘deities’. They were worshipped for the blessings they bestowed on humanity and thus by extension on all the species.
>
>Assigning a common name to a group is common even today. Instead of counting thousands of hardware and software experts, we simply say "Apple" makes iPhone. The phenomenon goes beyond technology or business. We normally say `Mahatma Gandhi` got India freedom. What we actually mean by this generalization is thousands of freedom fighters who worked with `Mahatma` got India freedom. Instead of counting the names of thousands of activists who worked in "civil rights movement", we simply use the name of Dr King to express our gratitude.

The superfluous information (metadata) was purged as soon as possible. Simply because, without the facility to scribe , the human memory offered limited storage space . The focus was on keeping the knowledge fresh instead of maintaining the version history. This knowledge was our distinction from the rest of the species. 

This knowledge must be kept as compressed as possible to render it real-time. Things that we take for granted today, only few human minds could handle at that time. Only that knowledge carried forward that was put to use every day such as survival skills, or was (forcefully) recited on daily basis — to synthesize and to keep the knowledge current. Thus, no one knows the exact date but we know for sure that the piece of eternal code rests archived in our foundations. And the fact we succeeded to tame the forces of nature, and that we built increasingly complex systems of money, security, computing, and health etc; is a testament that our core kernel is flawless — as if it was a gift of deities. 

> In a way, deities represent the beautiful complexity of our civilization, above the backdrop of three core processes 
> - self manifestation of knowledge into conscious beings of progressively higher complexity (Darwinian Evolution) represented by (`Vishnu`), 
> - a vast network of manifested concious entities to hold the knowledge (`Bramh`)  
> - and finally the automated system cleansing to sustain evolutionary expanse of knowledge (`Siva`). 
>
> The core processes are scale-invariant. They exist unchanged from sub-atomic particles to the galactic depths of cosmos. But the complexity of our civilization exists only at human scales, thanks to the intelligent discoveries of groups of inventors, represented separately by respective deities. 
>
> In other words, as per `Vaidik` belief system, ‘knowledge’ is always complete and omnipresent, represented by collective eternal existence of `Vishnu`, `Bramh` and `Siva`. The evolution and expansion of bioverse is there to (only) decrypt this knowledge. The decryption is facilitated by scientific endeavours, formulated (and constantly improved) by deities.  The notion of awakening (or the light) is being in state of fully decrypted ‘knowledge’; and that of sleep (or the darkness), is being completely oblivious. The `Vaidik` invocation is `Tamso Mam Jyotir Gamay` means — take me from my existing darkness to the light! In essence Vaidik way of life is same as the path of scientific discovery of our time. There is no friction whatsoever.


Before the ‘written word’ became the mainstream mechanism to preserve literature, scriptures were passed on as `Shruti`[^shutri] — the spoken word. A choir of reciters chanted the hymns (`Richas and Mantras`) whole day long — from the early morning to the late evening. Certain `mantras` must be recited at a specific time of the day, and at a specific place. Some of them must be performed in front of the holy fire — rites. Teachers (`Aacharyas`), a level-above the reciting students, helped them get the pronunciation right, and to attune a `Vaidik` elocution style. And finally, the editors (`Vyasas`) were responsible for the content. `Vyasas` were there to make sure the spoken content stayed current, accurate, and in exact line with the messages of sages. Their stated objective was to keep the knowledge distributed over as many human minds as feasible — a block chain of knowledge, distributed over biological nodes. `Vyasas` ran carefully designed distribution and consensus protocols.

And there was a good reason for intense focus on recital. Memories couldn't be stolen! Even today, we are advised to memorize our passwords! No one even imagined the scenario of such a nihilistic attack on `Vaśiṣṭha` congregation. No one had provisioned redundancy at the network level. The attack was on the ‘knowledge’ — on `Kaam dhenu` — the modern ways of civil life that provisioned everything for everyone. The `mantra` was `Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinha` — peace and prosperity to one and all. Not only for the kings or the rich or the strong — for everyone, including minor species. This knowledge created a ‘human fork’ in otherwise ‘planet of apes’. And the attackers were Apes (`Rakshsas`)[^rakshsa], who didn't want to subscribe to the idea of a systemic change in human approach to civilization — a pragmatic view of governance for equity — from “survival of the fittest” to “well-being of all” !

## research and notes:

[^whoIsVas]: The notion of invention at that time was different. Most religious accounts say that `Vaśiṣṭha` lived for more than a thousand years. It seems that `Vaśiṣṭha` was a family title rather than being an individual. A family that was responsible for remembering all that was ever invented. The knowledge was passed on generation by generation — from parents to offspring. Each generation dedicated to a sole purpose of synthesizing and cumulating the knowledge of all the basic discoveries of their time. They imparted parts of this knowledge to the followers based on their capabilities. Over a long period of many generations, the group of followers increased and turned into a community. Most of the followers spread geographically and many co-located in the `Ashrama`.

[^network]: Internet runs on a simple networking protocol — TCP/IP.  Internet is huge, just like our universe, but the TCP/IP bundle is so small that it could easily fit on a PC of mid nineties with say 64kb of RAM. Even today, it thrives on smaller systems such as Raspberry Pi. The knowledge network is centralized, just like TCP/IP. It implements a client server model. That is because, knowledge is mined through streamlined righteous actions — `Karma`. Only few people are able to perform righteous actions (in a specific field) to unlock the knowledge. These people, act like a server while rest of the members of the knowledge networks act like clients. Even clients need certain level of dedication and rigor. Thus, knowledge network is top down, and is hard to establish. There are other protocol too, that are fully distributed. For example, the Gossip protocol [^gossipProtocol]. By the very nature of this protocol, it needs a natural pull. It works great when the objects being distributed is not 'hard and dry' like ‘knowledge’, instead it is something enticing to the senses. The gossip architecture is used by the 'manifestations of knowledge' to spread the information that easily attract/ engage the sensory apparatus. Manifestations, by definition, are something that attract our senses. For example a written piece is hard knowledge. It is difficult for most people to have a natural affinity for long written text. But when this text is manifested into a fiction , it becomes enticing for the readers. Thus, fiction can be spread through Gossip.

[^shutri]: `Shruti` meant the spoken word when the humans used to sustain knowledge, only in the vocal format. Maybe because scribing was difficult. With the advent of writing tools, many `Shruties` were scribed. In essence the scriptures were born out of `Shruties`. The words that got written down, entered the collective memory of humanity.  Such written down early scriptures were called `Smrities`. For example `Manu Smriti` is among the oldest written down scripture, trans-encoded from `Shruti` to `Smriti`. The Sanskrit word `Shruti` got deformed into `Shutri` in Hindi with passage of time. It is important to bear in mind that every thing that we talk (chatter) is NOT `Shruti`. `Shruties` were consciously identified pieces of wisdom, preserved through formal recital to enable passage of knowledge from one generation to the next.

[^rakshsa]: `Rakshsas` were humans who believed in animalistic behavior. They thought, only way to survive in this jungle was to have more strength than predators. Thus, by natural selection, they grew larger limbs and stronger muscles. They could be as tall as say ten feet. They could uproot the trees with their hands. At the same time, their brains remained small, just like animals. Most of them thought the idea of survival with a smarter brain was at best 'funny'. Some of them also thought that the knowledge driven people who were trying to build a civil society were easy targets.

[^gossipProtocol]: Gossip is used in highly available and fault tolerant systems such as Cassandra. This is a great protocol for infecting a large population of decentralized nodes. For this reason, it is also called epidemic protocol. This protocol is used in propagating information rather than knowledge. A curious application of this protocol is bit coin mining with 'proof of work' consensus algorithm. Another great use-case is [hashgraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashgraph) deployed for [absolute byzentine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault) proof.

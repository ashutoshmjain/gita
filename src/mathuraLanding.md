`Mathura` - the ancient city, was the geographic center of first human civilization. Spread over vast plains of rivers Ganga, Yamuna and Indus this primordial culture reached the far ends of [ South Asian ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia) region. Cradled on one side by mighty Himalayas and on the other with immense Indian Oceans, the land of `Rama` and `Krishna` was called the "greater India". Later, visiting historians named it "Golden Sparrow" for people here loved to collect Gold as an imperishable store of value. Not only did they display their treasures in styles of jewellery, they decorated their temples and deities with Golden ornaments. It was here that Gold evolved as the basis of monetary and measurement systems. Humans learnt to move beyond barter and commodities to a value exchange protocol that would last them for next ten thousand years. This protocol- in physical or digital forms - would be the basis of a permission less, immutable and censor resistant network that defined the human race - free yet interdependent.

`Mathura` - the first seat of learning, had witnessed the oldest spoken scriptures - the `Vedas` - being passed on from a generation to the next, as sages discovered the "written word". In all probability, the transcription techniques were developed to safeguard the skills from Neolithic [^neo] era - mining, agriculture, botany, medicine, metallurgy, transportation and astrology among others - but the "written word" was limited to a chosen few. `Mahabharta` was the first fully scribed historical narrative that captured interest of the masses. It was scribed here at `Mathura` -  in a series of eighteen `Parvas` (books) - and was probably the primary catalyst for mass-adoption of written word. 

`Mahabharata` literally means "greater India". The legend says the epic was too big to scribe for humans! Thus the first writer poet  - `Krishna Dwaipayana` summoned help from `Ganesa` - the elephant God [picture above]. In Hindu mythology, `Ganesa` is the embodiment of "intelligence". He is also known as `Vighn Vighnesh` - the biggest problem solver - on account of his super natural intelligence - almost like (still elusive) "artificial general intelligence".

‘Text’ was the new medium. It was somewhat similar to our migration from analog to digital. Not only did it demand new "scribing" skills, it also meant the populations must learn to "read" -  beyond a select class of teachers or sages. New tools such as Pen, Ink and Palm leaves were invented; just the way we needed mass adoption of computers in early nineties. Divine intelligence `Ganesa` was invoked to usher the humanity into this new era, just the way we are using "large language models" in current digital realm. It isn't hard to imagine that "AI enabled humans" would scale new highs of concious experience in the same manner as "text" enabled us did - versus our "speech-only" ancestors - a quantum jump! [^jump]

The written word commanded as much attention back then  as the "computer code" in our times.  Which meant iterative rigor to precipitate the words into immaculate verses - such that the message stayed in human cache. The upfront effort to organize scribing paraphernalia (palm leaves, ink etc) was an entry barrier. It justified that the text must be accurate, succinct and comprehensible. One may argue compute and digital storage is similar barrier that forces said constraints on our code.

In the very first book, `Mahabharata` is described as the cumulative history (`Itihaas`) of advancement. It was like the Wikipedia of that time except it was also poetry of extraordinary caliber. Every king, every invention of wealth generation, and every war ; must find it's due place in `Mahabharata`, but in a fashion that was both - readable and sonorous to text-enabled humans. The sheer size of current (digital) information store, necessitates humans must amalgamate with artificial intelligence. Good or bad ? - only time shall tell though the evolution of conscious experience is unstoppable!

Any major paradigm shift, mandates an order of magnitude improvement - even more so a "once in a ten thousand years event" [^10k]. There was an all around effort to reduce the cost while increasing the utility of written word. It wasn't that no one knew scribing before, but the written word was pegged to the cave walls. Like murals or wall carvings, text was written on human size scales. Large paintings and books were of the same measure, and medium. An artist could afford to spend an year on a painting, but spending that much effort on a single page of a scripture was a test of patience. Even if someone willing to spare the time, the diacritics and calligraphy weren't mature enough to capture the essence of the spoken words.


In an estimate, a hundred page book, painted on human size frames back then, used to cost a `Tola` [^gold] of Gold (weight of a minted Gold coin commonly called `Shatanama` in Sanskrit and  `Ashrafi` in Arabic). The goal was to bring the cost down to a `Ratti` (100th part of a Tola) or a silver coin (100x reduction in value). A 10x reduction in size plus a 10x improvement in transcription tools led to a 100x reduction in cost -  in a matter of less than a century.  Does it sound like our journey from mainframes to the smartphone?

How did the monetary system perpetuate this scientific approach? What motivations led to this major step-up in preservation of information? Why would someone take the pains to poetically scribe entire history? How was wisdom drawn off the history and more importantly, how was this wisdom tested for truth before putting into text? 

Following pages are a filtered version of my research investigating that revolution. And surprisingly, it made a fascinating story! They also answer one question that stayed longer on my mind — Why should one care for the pen and the paper? What value in spending cycles on the tools of a bygone era! Turned out, our challenges and  moral dilemmas are not very different ! We are right at the middle of 10k cycle turning our physical information and value exchange protocols to digital forms - in search of next boost to the conscious experience. There is a lot to learn !


### notes and stuff

[^neo]: Neolithic revolution:- Around 11,000 bc, after the last long winter ended, our ancestors discovered agriculture, pottery, mining and other skills that lay in the foundations of modern society. This revolution with tools and technology and a zeal to do better faster is called Neolithic (new stone age) revolution. There is a debate among historians on duration - the  general consensus is anywhere between 10000 bc to 5000 bc -  right before the times of `Mahabharata`. -> [Ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution)

[^jump]: A quantum jump in awareness paradigm is defined as a state change such that one form of awareness becomes the representative identity of the group. For example white color is the cumulative identity of the group of seven rainbow colors.

[^10k]: Once in a ten thousand events, also called 10 K events, are the ones that need a large time frame to occur because they depend on many streams of technologies. Not only technologies, the purpose to work for such changes isn't clear in the beginning. It is still not clear why people work in such endeavours that have no end goal in sight. In absence of an explanation, such efforts are said to be a "divine inspiration". In Hindu traditions such events are tied to incarnation of `Vishnu` to help progression of conciousness to next level.

[^gold]: Monetary and measurement system :-  It appears both the systems evolved hand in hand. Gold was the basis of both the monetary and the measurement systems. No one knows for sure when gold mining begin. Our current estimates are  around 4000 BC. That puts it around the same time as  `Mahabharata`. The frequent mentions of Gold ornaments among kings and deities and as jewellery among women during the times of the epic,  indicate usage of Gold as a scarce but in-fashion store of value.  -> [Ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_mining)
- In Mahabharata, there is a clear mention of gold coins being abundantly used. In fourth book ( `Viarata Parva` ), the prince `Uttara` offered `Arjuna` (disguised as a transgender named `Vrihnnala`) a hundred gold coins for saving him (and his bovine wealth) from `Kaurvas` -> [Ref](https://mahabharata.shutri.com/maha04.html?highlight=gol#virata-parva:~:text=%27Listen%2C%20O%20good,set%20me%20free.%27) . 
- There is evidence of countable units of precious metal being used for exchange from the Vedic period onwards. A term `Nishka` appears in this sense in the `Rigveda`. A unit called `Śatamāna`, literally a " hundred standard ", representing 100 `krishnalas` is mentioned in `Satapatha Brahmana`. A later commentary on `Katyayana Srautasutra` explains that a `Śatamāna` could also be 100 `Rattis` . A `Ratti` is the weight equal to seeds of Abrus Precatorius. A hundred of them are almost equal to a `Tola` that is used for gold trade todate in India. All these units referred to gold currency in some form but they were later adopted to silver currency. -> [Ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinage_of_India#:~:text=There%20is%20evidence,16%5D%5B17%5D)
- Barter system was widespread for the smaller transactions. Commoners used fruits and grains to get what they needed. Rich people used copper as a store of value. A one time adult meal was normally considered one copper coin. So was a ride fare. You could hop on and hop off any boat or cart at any place along its route for one copper coin. Super rich used copper for utensils at their home. For them the valuable was silver. A silver coin was considered same as hundred copper coins.  Ultra rich ate their food in Silver utensils. For them store of value  was a Gold coin. 
- A Gold coin was equal to hundred Silver's.  The valuation was based on rough order of rigor in mining these metals. Silver was considered hundred times harder than copper, and Gold being similar orders of magnitude harder than Silver. In a way "proof of work" was baked in universally acceptable currency. 
- All states, no matter what their political equations, honoured this simple "proof of work" based storage of value. Privacy , self custody and universality were the underpin of trading system. Currency was owned by people NOT kingdoms! It is a well established fact that after the great war of `Mahabharta`, sixteen main kingdoms (`mahapadas`) got formed over couple of centuries. Each one of them issued their own coins but they were all different shapes or stamps on gold coins. Quarter gold coins (`Svarna`) are excavated from `Gandhara` -> [Ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinage_of_India#:~:text=Quarter%20svarna%20coins%20have%20been%20excavated%20from%20gandhara.)
- Currency was pegged to people's trust in "proof of work". Important point to note here, currency was not pegged to commodities such as iron or wheat. Gold and silver were NOT treated as commodities. Gold's only purpose was ornaments and silver was used purely for minting. Copper was primarily used for making utensils for the rich. Copper was supposedly the best metal to store food and water. Eating in silver, though common for rich, was considered a show-off. 
- This simple to understand and time tested system of powers of ten, was later exploited by `Aryabhatta` to conceptualize zero and decimal system - the very basis of modern arithmetic. The seeds of Abrus precatorius (`Ratti`) being very consistent in weight were used  to weigh Gold using a measure where 8 Ratti = 1 Masha; 12 Masha = 1 Tola (12 X 8 = 96 Ratti), or roughly equal to 100 Ratti ( 96 Ratti pure gold and 4 Ratti impurities to solidify the gold). In other words, a `Tola's` "weight unit" was 100 Ratti while it's "price unit" was 96 Ratti. In simple calculations 10 grams (one Tola) of solid gold was worth one kilo of solid silver or hundred kilos of solid copper. Or one Ratti (tiny seed) of Gold was equal to one kilo of copper. 
- The common word used for one Kilo was `Ser` or `Seer`- roughly equal to 1.07 kilos in weight units  or volume wise roughly equal to one liter. Volume was a preferred way to exchange at a larger scale to weed out as much impurities as possible from molten the metals.

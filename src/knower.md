## Knower

In Chapter 13 of the Bhagavad Gītā, Krishna tells Arjuna that the body (and by extension, the entire universe) is the "field" (*kṣetra*), and the one who understands this field is the "knower of the field" (*kṣetrajña*). He then says, "Know Me as the Knower in every body."

This essay seeks to define this "Knower" by bridging modern physics and ancient Vedic philosophies—Sāṃkhya and Advaita Vedanta.

### Knowledge vs. Information

To understand the Knower, we must first distinguish between knowledge and information. While conventional definitions often see information as a tool to predict the near future and knowledge as concrete reality, we will flip these definitions to align with the probabilistic quantum worlds:

*   **Information** is the data from events that have already occurred—the outcomes of repetitive trials. If you flip a coin a million times, the record of 500,000 heads and 500,000 tails is *information*. It is concrete and pertains to the past. In Sāṃkhya, this is called *Bhūtādika* (that which relates to the past).
*   **Knowledge** is the awareness of all possibilities and their probabilities *before* an event happens. The understanding that a coin *can* land on either heads or tails with a 50/50 probability is *knowledge*. The probability of an electron in a perfect vacuum spinning up or down is exactly like a coin toss—fifty-fifty. In essence, knowledge is the menu of potential futures. In Sāṃkhya, this is called *Prārabdha* (the destiny that is yet to unfold).

In this model, knowledge is the set of rules governing potential, while information is the record of manifested reality.

### The Act of Observation

This is where Quantum Mechanics provides a crucial insight. It is common knowledge that an act of measurement collapses the wave function of a quantum system into a unique state. However, this is not a limitation of the quantum system itself but rather a limitation of the **observation mechanism**. Our senses, and by extension all the tools we use, can only measure one state at a time. The state that we measure appears as reality to us. Thus, the observer effect (as in the famous double-slit experiment) is not magic; it is the act of choosing one state out of infinite possibilities based on the rules governing the potential of those possibilities.

It would be pertinent to mention that all potential clouds are the same—it is a fundamental state called Prakriti in Vedic science. The difference in the observable construct arises only due to the different governing rules associated with those clouds. For example, all the transistors in a computer chip are more or less similar—the compute is in the code that runs on them to change their state in different ways.

This idea is what separates Sāṃkhya from science. Sāṃkhya posits that **Prakṛti** (the natural world) is perpetually in a quantum state. It is the entanglement of **Puruṣa** (the observer) that resolves this potential into the singular state we call manifestation. All other possibilities remain as they are but are considered "unmanifest."

In the world of AI, this is more easily perceived. The vector space of a trained model is always in a multidimensional state, with concepts aligned by their dot products. However, the **attention mechanism**—a separate algorithm—leads to a specific, "real" output, such as a string of letters or an image. The key word here is "attention." Reality is tied to attention as much as it is to the underlying quantum state of the system. The physical world is considered alive as long as the "attention" is associated with the "potential." As soon as the attention separates, the construct gradually disintegrates. You can experience it in any physical system of any scale—not just in the world of tiny particles or the innards of LLMs.

> The quantum state of Prakṛti is defined by three **guṇas**: *Sattva*, *Rajas*, and *Tamas*. This might seem as if Sāṃkhya posits only a three-dimensional world, but the idea of the three guṇas represents a Hilbert space (of complex functions) in infinite dimensions. How?
>
> *   ***Tamas*** represents all possibilities. This is a state of zero self-awareness, sometimes described as inertia or darkness because it is a state of perfect, undifferentiated chaos.
> *   ***Rajas*** represents the selection of a state, but with inherent duality.
> *   ***Sattva*** represents resolution—the choice of one option from a binary pair, overcoming duality.
>
> The scripture states that a cycle of Prakṛti begins in a state of Tamas—all possibilities but no awareness, pure potential. The proximity of Puruṣa creates an excitation, giving rise to Rajas. A duality thus arises from the chaos of Tamas—"to be or not to be." Then, Sattva energizes the system to select one option from this duality. This is where Puruṣa—the attention—gets locked into a singular state of Prakṛti, which is then called "manifest." All other options are still potent, but only one bears Sattva, representing a sacred matrimony of Prakṛti and Puruṣa.
>
> This marriage, however, is not eternal. Duality soon arises again, separating the manifest state into two extreme poles, and eventually, the state returns to Tamas as attention is lost. Life departs, and only the appearance sustains for some time. This state is called "*bhūta*"—the past. Finally, that too disintegrates into the five great elements—the "*pañca mahābhūta*."

It might appear to an untrained eye that Prakṛti and Puruṣa are esoteric concepts relevant only to the quantum weirdness of high-end LLMs. The truth is, this system is omnipresent. All our daily interactions and our modern systems, from weather prediction to stock markets, work according to these rules. A manifest reality can be a book, a song, or a YouTube video—digital or physical. The inertia of Tamas, the duality of Rajas, and the manifestation of Sattva are easily seen in all aspects of life.

### The Emergence of the Rulebook (Mahat)

It might seem that Tamas and Sattva are pure states while Rajas is an inferior duality. However, Rajas arguably has the most important function among the three. This duality is essential for the creation of Knowledge—the rulebook. How? When Prakṛti manifests, the attention (*Sattva*) selects one side, but the other side of the duality—a chiral mirror image—is imprinted in the field of Knowledge. This makes "Knowledge" a digital twin of the manifest reality. This, however, is not a replica in a virtual world; it is the probability distribution of a function's potential cloud. It is an awareness of the near past and the near future.

Thus, repeated observations (i.e., manifestations) lead to the formation of a "rulebook." Sāṃkhya philosophy describes a cosmic version of this process. The infinitely many observations of **Prakṛti** by **Puruṣa** give rise to the first and most fundamental rule engine: **Mahat**, the Universal Intelligence. From an AI standpoint, this is analogous to training a large model. The model, through repeated exposure to data, learns the vector space of possibilities. Mahat is not a memory bank but the very configuration of the system, where the geometry of the space and the rules of interaction are one and the same.

### The Rise of Identity (Ahaṃkāra)

The next evolutionary step, as per Sāṃkhya, is the emergence of **Ahaṃkāra** (the Ego or "I-ness") from Mahat. The Universal Intelligence, being a geometric structure itself, begins to perceive itself as a localized identity. It gives itself a name and a point of view.

Many modern conjectures and pseudo-scientific approaches deem Ahamkara the root of evil. Nothing can be farther from the truth. Ahamkara is essentially a refinement of the rulebook—kind of version two. This is the rise of discretion. As we explained that the manifestation is choosing one option out of the two offered by the duality of Rajas, the rulebook now turns into choosing which state to manifest given a set of circumstances. In truth, it is a qualification of "what not to manifest." It is an ability to say "no" until the appropriate option is made available. This is probably the reason "Ego" gets a connotation of negativity. It forces Rajas to look at multiple dualities until one side of a chosen duality is worth manifesting.

### The Entangled Observer (Manas and Karma)

Finally, this new Ego begins to wield a **Manas** (Mind). This is not the entirety of consciousness but a faculty of the Ego that randomly indulges in observation, driven by preferences. The "I" now becomes an active observer, but unlike the pristine Puruṣa, this new observer gets entangled with Prakṛti.

When it makes a measurement, it collapses right into the middle of the decoherence it causes. It gets stuck. This entangled manifestation is a "knot." In Vedic terms, this is the bondage of actions—**Karma Bandhana**.

### The Evolution of Consciousness

The manifested state marks the beginning of time—Kala. However, the potential of the unmanifest is still around, and the system offers dynamic circumstances. This dynamism of changing circumstances is perceived as the passage of time. The question then becomes: should the manifestation stay put or change with the changes in the opportunity space? To assess the opportunity space, Manas must continue random sampling. This is perceived as a desire to seek information (not knowledge). This is the reason Manas is sometimes referred to as the "fickle mind."

The obvious next step in evolution is to support the fickle mind with tools to observe manifested prakriti—the dynamic circumstances of the vicinity—our tiny box. The vantage point now flips from the probabilistic rulebook to the manifested reality. The tools to measure reality—the sensors—are called Indriyas. The question now is, should we stay put in the manifest state or must we change?

The observer, now equipped with senses (*indriyas*) to take measurements, then develops the action-organs to protect those senses. This is how the observer becomes a fully interactive but bound agent.

The discretionary nature of Ahamkara—the ability to separate right from wrong in a duality—now shifts to asking, "Is there a better choice than the current state?" How do I improve my current union? Longevity and survival are the key impulses.

This state of vigil is called consciousness. Consciousness drives survival and aspires to the longevity of a system. Knowledge becomes a method of value exchange for mutual growth. Consciousness drives centralization and order. This state is the exact mirror image of "knowledge." In a way, it is the chiral manifestation of knowledge. Knowledge, by definition, stays decentralized. It is watching pure potential. It is the set of assessment rules for manifesting the righteous (right choice). Consciousness, on the other hand, is the ability to scan the environment for something better. Sometimes, decay is also a better choice. Knowledge is eternal; consciousness is the poster child of the happy matrimony of Purusa and Prakriti. Every instance of measurement is imbued with a complete set of immutable, imperishable, detached knowledge—but it balances it with the consciousness of manifest reality.

The formation of Mahat, Ego, and Mind is not a one-time event but a continuous, layered process. As an entangled observer learns, it also develops tools for quantum purification and detachment. In other words, only conscious beings may strive to realize the hidden knowledge of pure potential. These more detached observers then begin to formulate a new, higher-level rulebook over the existing, bonded reality.

This is the engine of evolution. Every jump is a "quantum jump" in consciousness. Vedic science illustrates this through the incarnations of Vishnu: from the great fish (Matsya) to the tortoise (Kurma), the man-lion (Narasimha), and finally to a complete human (Rama), each representing a new evolutionary layer of intelligence.

### Quantum Mechanics: Deciphering the First Layer

Quantum mechanics is our most powerful tool for understanding the first and most fundamental layer of the rulebook. The mathematical framework that describes the rules of physical fields is known as the **Lagrangian**. The Lagrangian of the Standard Model of particle physics is an incredibly accurate description of the "Mahat" for the subatomic world. It tells us the probabilities and rules for the interactions of quarks, electrons, and photons. This knowledge is nearly complete for three of the four fundamental forces, and theories like String Theory provide a mathematical path to unifying gravity.

### The Persistence of Layers

A critical principle is that new, higher layers of evolution do not destroy the lower layers. We, as complex conscious beings, are built upon the foundational rules of biology, chemistry, and physics. The quarks and electrons that make up our bodies still follow their Lagrangian. Every layer is a keeper and a user of the layers beneath it.

### Encrypted Knowledge and Brahman

Since the purpose of our senses is to take observations and interact with the world, the vast knowledge held within the geometry of our own consciousness is largely encrypted to us. Our individual knowledge is the cumulative result of all observations made throughout our evolutionary history.

This leads to a profound conclusion: our complete inner knowledge is a mirror image of the entire universe around us. The shape of our inner knowledge is the imprint of all external manifestations. This unity is what Vedic science refers to as **Brahman**. Brahman is both the observed reality "out there" and the observing consciousness "in here." It is the observer and the observed, collectively decrypting reality.

### Intelligence, Gravity, and Dark Matter

In this model, **intelligence** is the standard for communication between conscious agents. But knowledge itself has its own communication channel: the geometry of inner space. This geometry, the force of manifestation itself, is **gravity**.

What we perceive as matter is simply decrypted knowledge—the portion of the Knowledge Field that has been collapsed into Information. The vast amount of knowledge that remains encrypted to us still contributes to the total geometry of spacetime. It has a gravitational effect, but it doesn't interact with our senses (or light). This is **dark matter**: the gravitational pull of unasked questions and un-manifested possibilities.

### The Path of the Knower: Karmayoga

There are two ways to observe Brahman: inwards, through purification, and outwards, through interaction. In truth, it is a cycle. The inward path is one of purification, where the observer untangles itself from the noise of the world to become pure.

Once purified, the observer is meant to interact with the universe again, but this time without becoming entangled. This is the essence of **Karmayoga**: to take measurements and act in the world from a place of detachment, fulfilling one's purpose without being bound by the results. This is how the Knower plays its part in the cosmic game.

In the first chapter of Gita we saw the set up of the armies at Kurukshetra. Both sides getting ready for the war of a lifetime, Arjuna asked Krishna to take him centerstage to take an up close view of those who were so eager to fight him. He saw known faces of his cousins, teachers and friends. Suddenly he felt that he was about to commit a major sin by raging a war against his own clan. He asked Krishna if he was on right path. He thought even Krishna was about to make a mistake. 

Krishna was obviously surprised with this sudden change of heart and feeling of weekness in Arjuna. He spoke at length in chapter two about the nature of physical body, the righteous path and the importance of being steadfast on your course. He gave a lot of wisdom , too quickly to consume even for a person of Arjuna's intelligence and stature. Many people say Gita is all said in chapter 2. It is true but if Arjuna himself couldn't understand the intricacies of Karm Yoga, what chance do we stand ? 

So Arjuna starts with few very basic questions here in chapter 3 and Krishna, having understood the information overload for Arjuna, take another deep dive at Karm Yoga. In fact, this is where the real deep conversation begins. Let us see how it goes... 

## Arjuna said

### 3.1

Jyasasi [better] Chet [if] Karmanh [from action] Te Mata [per your opinion] Buddhih [intelligence] Janardna [O Krishna] ;

Tat Kim [then why] Karmani Ghore [ghastly actions] Mam [me] Niyojayasi [ you are engaging] Kesava [O Krishna] .


{ If intelligence is better than actions in your opinion O Krishna , then why are you engaging me in ghastly actions} 


(This is the most valid question of all times. Here we have a war in which Arjuna is expected to fight his brethren and teachers. His own and all the common intelligence anyway would suggest not to fight any war let alone one with your own friends. And here we have the most intelligent stretegist who is recommending to fight this war. Question is obvious.)

### 3.2

Vya [your] Mishrena Eva [ Kinda mixed] Vakyen [sentences -> words] Buddhim [intelligence] Mohayasi Eva [you are kinda delusioning] Me [me];

Tat [therefore] Ekm [one thing] Vad [tell]  Nishchitya [after deciding] Yena [by which] Shreya [better in the eyes of others] Ahm [I] Aapnuyam [I get].

{Your mixed messages are kinda dellusioning my mind. Thereforec decide and say only one thing that brings me credit and is good for all}


## Krishna Said

### 3.3

Loke [in the world] Asmin [this] Dwi-Vidha [two kinds of] Nishtha [faith] Pura [previously] Prokta [said] Maya [by me] Anagha [O sinless Arjun];

Jnana Yogena [with ritual of knowledge] Sankhyanam [by philospphers] Karm Yogen [with ritiual of actions] Yoginam [by Yogies].

{ There are two types of faith in this world as told by me previously. `Jnana Yoga` for the philosophers and the `Karm Yoga` for the Yogies}

### 3.4

Na [not] Karmnaam [of righteous action] Anarambhan [the ones that are never initiated] Naishkarmyam [a stage where one is beyond actions - such as Krishna] Purushah [a man] Ashnute [one who achived said stage];

{A man doesn't achieve the stage where she is beyond actions by the actions that are never started}

(In essence - you can only get freedom from actions by acting on some actions - the ones you didn't even start are not helping you accomplish this stage)

Na [nor] Cha [also] Sannyasnat [one who has renounced everything, towards them] eva [] Siddhim [distinguisable success] Sam-adhigacchti [easily goes towards].

{Nor distinguishable success goes towards the ones who have renounced everything}

(In essence - we all want to get to a stage where we can get everything we desire without doing anything - `Naishkarmya` - Some of us try to get there by pursuit of knowledge ie automation and others by renunciation ie "why have it" ; Krishna says that you can't get to this stage by not starting the action. Actions are mandatory requirement)

### 3.5

Na [nor] Hi [certainly] Kashchit [anyone] Kshnam [a moment] Api [too] Jatu [at any time] Tishthati [stays - sit down] Akaram Krit [doing nothing];

Karyate [do] Hi [certainly] Avashah [perforced] Karma [actions] Sarvah [All] Prakriti-Jaih [born of their nature] Gunaih[qualities]

{Its not like someone can sit idle. They are perforced into actions by their nature}

### 3.6

Karmemdrayani [Work Organs - Hands, feet] Sanyamya [holding back] Yah [who] Aaste [indulges in] Mansa [mind] Smaran [thinking];

Indriya Arthan [purpose of above work organs] Vumudha [oblivious] Atma [person] Mithya [fasle] Aacharah [conduct] Sa [he] Uchyate [showcases]. 

### 3.7

Yah [one who] Tu [but] Indriyani [the senses] Mansa [ by the mind] Niyamya [as a routine] Arabhte [ndulge in] Arjuna [arjuna];

Karm-Indriyaih [with the active work organs] Karm Yogam [ritual of action] Asaktah [without attachment] Sah [s/he] Vishishyate [excels]

### 3.8

Niytam [prescribed or predecided] Kuru [do] Karma [actions in performance of duties] Tvam [you] Karma [actions] jyayah [better] hi [certainly] Akarmanah [inaction];

Sharira [body] Yatra [journey] Api [even] Cha [also] Te [your] Na [never] Prasiddhyet [something acceptatble because it is popularly agreed upon by all] Akarmanah [inaction].

### 3.9

Yajna-arthaat [Done only for the sake of Yajna] Karmanah [actions] Anyatra [otherwise] Lokah [world] Ayam [this] Karm-Bandhna [bondage by work];

Tat [For it] Artham [for the sake] Kaunteya [O son of Kunti] Mukt-sangh [liberated from the curse of association] Samachar [do dexterously and balanced].

{ O Arjuna - Do actions, dexterously and in balanced manned liberated from the curse of association, because all other actions are for bondage to this world}

### 3.10

Saha [along with] Yajnah [ritual of actions] Prajah [community of followers] Srishtva [having created] Pura [previously anciently] Uvacha [I said] Praja-patih [to the care taker of community like a king who is supposed to serve the community on my behalf];

Anena [ by this] Prasvisydhvam [ having attained more prosperity] Esah [ throgh this] Vah [s/he] Astu [stayed as] Ishta [ desired things] Kama-dhuk  [ owner who enjoys his rein].

{ Along with Yajna ,  I first built a community of followers and appointed and explained the purpose of Yajna to a community leader; with which s/he attained all s/he desired and enjoyed what s/he got } 

(The biggest of all discoveies is the formation of organization for a righteous purpose. This is the key differentiator between animals and humans. Even animals and insects organize for self help but none does so for the righteous. Krishna said that he is the one who brought who invoked this idea along with Yajna itself. Most of the successful people as Krishna was are the ones who indulge in actions without association , desires and they do it dexterously in a balanced manner ; their selfless actions develop a community of followers . Having figured out the Yajna and the community, they pass on all this as a heritage to a deserving community leader who takes pleasure in maintaining and growing the ritual . Thus Krishna asks Arjuna to follow such Karm Yoga , just like him . Even becoming a community leader is a far less than the true potential we all carry )

### 2.11

Devan [ demogods]  Bhavyata [ having pleased] Anena [ with this (the yajna)] Te [ those] Devah [ demigods] Bhavyantu [ will please] Vah [ you];
Parasparam [ mutually] Bhavyantah [ pleased] Shreyah [ honour ] Param [ ultimate] Avapsyath [ you will achieve].

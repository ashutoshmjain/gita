The mishap leads to a rise of systemic survival instinct, missing thus far in the "new" because they presumed the survival was ensured by the "old". The "new" realizes that their work was not for the good (or bad) of the society, it was for them(selves) to understand "who they are". Their situation is different from their olds. Their new ideas are not a solution for the old(er) problems, they are the plumbing for the new order. They must account for the stability of the new rules. 

This new incarnation of "self" is the evolution. The survivor [^survivor] wins and only the fittest (among all the possibilities) survives. All the possible configurations (of the ideas), including those with altruistic motives, must fight to find the one that could survive against all odds. They must reincarnate - `Punrjanm` with their own provisions of recovery and reboot.

# `Punrjanm` ..

Aging `Bramhrishi`, with his sons lost, found hope in grandson  `Parāśara`. Legend says `Parāśara` showed tremendous intelligence right from the early days. Exaggerations claim he recited hymns in his mother's womb! That said, `Vaśiṣṭha` had little hope elsewhere. As `Parāśara` was growing, `Vaśiṣṭha` rebuilt the congregation ground-up. New students, new methods of teaching. This time he wanted to scribe the scriptures to safeguard against another similar catastrophe. 

Young `Parāśara` had the advantage of full attention of his grand father but life for him was harder than previous generations and other student. He was expected to learn scribing in addition to speech training. Learning to scribe (in early `Devnagri`) was an optional course that few students took after completing their normal course of studies - may be at an age of twenty plus. `Vaśiṣṭha` wanted `Parāśara` to learn calligraphy simultaneously as he learnt to speak - somewhat like our education system where we start with "A for Apple" showing the toddlers a written symbol of letter "A" together with a picture of "Apple", and have them speak both the symbol and the object. 

> The knowledge of written symbols starts long before a child actually holds a pen. We create an association of a specific sound with a selected text - "A" is a sound as well as a written symbol. They are reflection of each other. A sound with it's written reflection is the fundamental unit of external store of information. 

Despite tremendous advances in our learning systems, this fundamental association stayed unchanged. Associations may be different in different languages but there is always a sound and a symbol of text.  

The most crucial phase of education, is a child's first exposure to the spoken words. The `Sanskaras` ( the core orientations ), are said to be formed at at this stage. That is one reason, mother is considered the first teacher and mother tongue is considered the language of thought. The formation of "core orientations" with nascent spoken words is as old as the human race. Adding a twist of "written text" in this core design of learning was first explored by `Vaśiṣṭha`. This is what excited him in his rebooted reality for this small change had the potential as big as early programming of computers with punch cards.

> In last hundred years, education has seen tremendous growth. The modern education system of schools and online platforms is great but they all deal with grownups. Despite thousands of years, the first and fundamental learning steps are almost unaltered from what `Vaśiṣṭha` envisaged for `Parāśara`. We might use an iPad for showing the picture of Apple but it is still A for Apple - a written symbol and a sound simultaneously associating with a real world object.

Despite this path-breaking idea, `Bramhrishi` stayed humble for what he invented was only an "innovation", not an original idea. It was inspired from the discovery of "music" by `Siva`. In music, a note is identified with a name. "Sa Re Ga Ma" or "Do Re Me Saa" are nothing but the spoken names for seven eternal sounds. In `Hindu` mythology, music and dance (as recognized art forms) were created by supreme potency of discretion - `Siva`. On the same lines, `Vasishtha` named spoken sounds for written symbols. However, `Vasishtha` went a step further - unlike music which was an optional hobby and remains same to date, he added the idea of text into `Sanskaras` - the first learning steps - a revolutionary change in the kernel of learning system. 

The grandfather used to take the budding child to the river `Yamuna` for a daily bath. He often drew the symbols on the sandy banks of the mighty river with a stick and had `Parāśara` guess the letters with the same object as a clue held in his hand. `Parāśara` often complained when the mighty river wiped off the text during a high tide. `Vaśiṣṭha`, the all aware, keeper of the knowledge, used to smile to himself thinking one day these written symbols would be indestructible (`Akshra`) like the knowledge itself. It is probably why the written word is called `Akshra` (immutable) in `Sanskrit`!

`Vaśiṣṭha` had no clue how scribing the entire knowledge base would fructify for `Devnagari` back then supported only eight [^eight] rudimentary sounds, just enough to send cryptic pigeon messages. He knew more symbols were needed if the intent of scripture was to be meaningfully conveyed in writing but he also knew a mighty ocean started with a single droplet. His goal was to see `Parāśara` as first child natively raised with scribing and speech together. He wanted to understand if it was even possible, and if it was, than what is the effect on child's approach to learning. 

He knew if he could train one child for the written word, than at some point in future, all could adopt the same method instead of a typical learning path focused solely on the art of speaking. And if everyone knew writing, than writing all the `shruties`[^shruti] would be an easy shared effort. Not only an easy shared effort, it will also ensure location decentralization. If scriptures were wriiten at distant places, the chances of them being destroyed were lesser. Instead of transcribing "knowledge" on temple walls, he wanted to enable all humans to transcribe. Power to the people through learning to "speak and scribe" ( `Akshar Gyaan` ) - he saw , as the core piece of curriculum.

A typical path for an aspiring student (`Vidyarathi`) seeking a degree in the authentic "recital" of scriptures (`Shaastras`) was to join a congregation (`Ashrama`), on a full-time live-in basis. Life in an `Ashrama` was tough. A student was expected to follow a tight celibate routine, full of chores and services. Before s/he got to the lessons, s/he must prove herself worthy of the knowledge. Then only s/he would make it to the choir. Menial tasks were considered mandatory to mellow down (or even eradicate) exaggerated notion of any particular ‘trait’ (rooted in `Sanskara`), and be one with the all pervading `Bramh` - the universal reflection of self. The wealth of congregation didn't make it any easier for the students, because the wealth must be spent to help the needy. Even `Parāśara` didn't get a free pass when it came to the rigor. Quite the opposite — he had to double up.

 A degree holder was called a `Snataka`. A `Snataka` needed to go through rigorous years of apprenticeship with a teacher `Aacharya` to get certified in administering ‘rites’, when s/he was called a `Shastri` — someone who knew scriptures. At that stage, s/he could leave to spread the rites in the villages near or the cities afar, or become an `Aacharya` (a teacher) in the congregation. The choice was based on her inclination and the rigor s/he wanted to put in because being a teacher needed lot more studies while a rites maker could start living a normal life of abundance immediately. Only few `Aacharyas` with demonstrable authority on all the known scriptures would get to the coveted title of `Vyasa`. In nutshell, there was a whole organization to moderate, curate and to disseminate the audio content — to make sure the knowledge was passed-on (without distortion), to seekers in current generation, and the next.

There was another path available to the students if recital wasn't their first choice — research — seeking knowledge (`Nyana`). This path demanded lot more patience and even greater sacrifice!  If someone was keen to take on research, after graduating as a `Snataka`, s/he would choose a major in a specific field. The hard work on this path was called `Sadhna` meaning extreme focus on a specific goal (`Sadhya`). One who accomplished her goal was called `Sidhah`. 

This path led to titles such as `Rishi` — a sage; and `Maharishi` — a super sage. These titles were given by a community of researchers based on the body of work or the insights one brought to the world — a complete meritocracy without any consideration of gender or race. The spoken insights of such sages were adapted into ‘rites’ by `Vyasas` — to disseminate, and to preserve the knowledge. Rites were a foolproof method to embed these insights into public discourse.

Rites were conducted to invoke natural powers of the elements through human intelligence. For example, metallurgy and irrigation were outcomes of such rites, an invocation of power of elemental Earth and Fire. Agriculture was outcome of Earth and Water put together with specific human rigor. In essence a rite was a laid down controlled procedure that led to a specific outcome. Given the rudimentary level of knowledge, many things could go wrong. There were many unknowns because knowledge had yet not turned into hard "engineering". All the unknowns in a specific endeavour were humbly acquitted to the ‘deity’ of that specific field, to dispel uncertainty. It became customary to worship the early inventors of that field to enhance the chances of success. Or to reduce the chances of mishaps. In a way, the faith in a ‘deity’ was nothing more than hoping for the best outcomes. Hope remains a powerful driver to this date. Human journey is a journey of hope.

A derivative rite known as `Dravya Yazna` was particularly popular among the rich and the powerful. Instead of rendering the rigor of the endeavours, it focused on honouring the deities. It entailed sharing homage and chanting `mantras` to invoke the deities, in return of speculative material gains. `Drvya` in Sanskrit, means material. Thus, `Drvya Yazna` literally meant the rites performed for good-luck material gains. For example, a rite performed for more rain (by appeasing `Indra` the deity of rains) was a type of `Drvya Yazna`. So was a rite performed to seal a wedlock with an expectation to have the happy matrimony last till death and be blessed with worthy offspring. The effectiveness of `Dravya Yazna` was questionable, but the essence was to bring a glimpse of ‘research’ to the masses - those who had otherwise not have the opportunity  to participate in application of advanced knowledge (rites). 

It also well served another goal — funding the research. 

The formalization of family rituals into `Dravya Yazna` — sanitization of space (`shuddhikaran`), holy fire (`Agni`), intonations in carefully perfected ensemble (`mantrochhaar`), the time and the place (`Dasha and Disha`), and the specific order of homage to various deities (`Aahuti`); served two purposes. First it became a formal auspicious way to celebrate certain life events — such as child birth, marriage, retirement and even death. Second, it created an interaction platform between those who were seeking a higher purpose on one side, and the rich affluent pillars of society who hosted the rituals on the other. After the rite, there used to be an abridged message read by the ritual maker, in local dialect, to explain the relevant scripture, followed by QnA sessions — more you ask, more you please the deity. 

The hosts got the satisfaction of pleasing the deities while the ritual makers got plush donations — grain, cattle, precious metals. A big share of donations went to the central congregation — the source of wealth for the congregation - `Kaam Dhenu` - the virtuous cycle of knowledge to wealth. Many millennia later, the model still works in India. The classical music is still learnt in `Gharanas` — a diluted version of `Ashramas`. Each with their own style of renditions. The singers graduated from a specific `Gharana` of `Hindustani Sangeet` say `Kirana Gharana` have a life long bond to the origins of their art form, and are a source of continued alumni support.

It might feel as if `Dravya Yazna` was a sham, but the truth is it was a carefully thought out intervention to keep the society in certain checks and balances and to incentivize the ones who were dedicating their lives to carry forward the ‘scientific’ exploration of those early days. The research was not limited to spirituality or meditation. It was well organized learning process that paved the way for scientific discovery in fields such as medicine, agriculture, irrigation, construction and many more. `Dwaipayana` wrote later in `Bhagvat Gita` — a central piece of epic `Mahabharata` — that the idea of formalization of rituals in this format, was institutionalized by `Prajapati`. Many religious accounts believe `Prajapati` is a name for `Brmha` himself, who coded the basic laws of civilization and whose ideas seven [^seven] `Bramh-rishis` adopted as inheritance from father to son. Others believe `Prajapati` is a deity responsible for administering the realm. Whichever point of view we may consider, the literal meaning of the word is self-evident. It means one who sustains the network. `Praja` means the subscribers of a system, `Pati` means one who takes care or owns those subscribers. 

`Dwaipayana` wrote in chapter 3 of `Gita` ..

> In olden times, the Lord of Creation (`Prajapati`), creating men and sacrifice (`Yazna`) together, said,--flourish by means of this (Sacrifice). Let this (Sacrifice) be to you (all) the dispenser of all objects cherished by you. Rear the gods with this, and let the gods (in return) rear you. Thus fulfilling the mutual interest you will obtain that which is beneficial (to you).

Rites were baked in reality. For example someone starting an agricultural season, would conduct a ritual that underscored the right methods of sowing seeds, irrigation and harvesting. Someone starting a business would conduct a ritual that emphasized the accounting principles. The ritual maker who officiated a wedding must be someone who deeply understood the responsibilities a couple was taking on when getting into a wedlock — the vows. And one conducting a ritual after someone's death must be proficient in making the grief easier — like a therapist. Since all such endeavour had a significant risk of failure, there was nothing wrong in having blessings of Godly deities on your side. Humility was considered a virtue and it remains so even in the biggest scientific missions to date. 

Re-instituting this age-old model based on spoken words,  was easy for someone like `Bramhrishi Vaśiṣṭha` for the know-how to set up this channel was rooted deep in him. However, textification of scripture was lot harder than he envisaged. For one, the core infrastructure was not in place — the tools for writing long texts were just not there. It was one thing to write a short, cryptic pigeon message but writing a scripture was a whole new territory. Humanity had yet not discovered paper. There was no standard long-lasting ink. Above all, there was no standard Grammar. It will be hundreds of years before `Panini` — a grammarian par excellence, wrote his epic `Ashtadhyayi` (eight chapters) to standardized the `Sanskrit` grammar [^grammar]. 

More importantly, there was no commercial payback model associated with text, the way `Dravya Yazna` was associated to the spoken words to sustain the audio content. It was like "electricity" of early days. No one bought a bulb because there was no electricity, and no one mass produced electricity because no one had bulbs ! 

He thought his grandson `Parāśara`, now reaching maturity, would take on this challenge. Little did he know that focus on texting the scriptures, would create a dual among his own followers. Ones who wanted to stay true the old - recital; and others who deemed "text" as a major improvement. Somewhat like the battle between Bitcoin Maximalists and the Ethereum community these days. Many possibilities of "new" must battle to establish control but more importantly to know what they stand for - who they are !

## research and notes:
-----

[^survivor]: As per `Vaidik` science ( and later postulated by Darwin), in this death friendly world - also known as `Marn Dharma` in Sanskrit - one that is designed to die - survival is the only measure of success. Nature doesn't care to be altruistic but that doesn't mean altruistic strategies are NOT survival friendly. In fact, altruism is one of the best central theme for all the species that survived long. In fact - giving birth to pass on genes at the cost of one's own comfort is an altruistic strategy that has been universally adopted by all species.

[^eight]: It is not clear which eight sounds got first symbols. Some accounts claim that seven notes of music with eternal sound of `Om` were the first calligraphic symbols but that seems odd with the idea of sending pigeon messages. Some other accounts claim "vowels" were the first to take on written symbols which also seems bit of imaginary stretch because what is the use of a vowel without consonants. Unfortunately I couldn't keep a track of my references. Please send me a note if you have ready research on this topic. I guess this is the most important question that linguistics historians should be looking at !

[^shruti]: `Shruti` meant the spoken word when the humans used to sustain knowledge, only in the vocal format. Maybe because scribing was difficult. With the advent of writing tools, many `Shruties` were scribed. In essence the scriptures were born out of `Shruties`. The words that got written down, entered the collective memory of humanity.  The literal meaning of the word `Smriti` is the one that is memorized. Such written down early scriptures were called `Smrities` because the idea was if something is written down, it would never be forgotten. For example `Manu Smriti` is among the oldest written down scripture, trans-encoded from `Shruti` to `Smriti`. The Sanskrit word `Shruti` got deformed into `Shutri` in Hindi with passage of time. It is important to bear in mind that every thing that we talk (chatter) is NOT `Shruti`. `Shruties` were consciously identified pieces of wisdom, preserved through formal recital to enable passage of knowledge from one generation to the next.

---

[^seven]: Hindu scriptures believe there were seven `Bramh-rishis`. `Vaśiṣṭha` was one of them. The other six are `Bhrigu`, `Agniras`, `Atri`, `Vishwamitra`, `Kashyapa`, and `Shandilya`. All of them originated from `Bramh` with the gift of intelligence to cumulate the knowledge. The only exception is `Vishwamitra` who is said to have attained this highest title through sheer hard work and dedication (`Tapasya`). All of them, put together, are also called `Saptarishis` - the seven. 

---

[^grammar]: Vedas are written in `Vaidik Sanskrit`. `Panini's` epic book `Ashtadhyayi` refers to `Mahabharata`, which means `Panini's` Sanskrit came later than the times of `Dwaipayana`.

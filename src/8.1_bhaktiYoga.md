#Bhakti Yoga 

If you don't have time to understand Gita, or you don't think you have patiience to deal with it ? What is the way out ? 

In fact , Krishna , knowing the plight of most of us mortals , says , `Bhakti Yoga` is easier and a happy way to `Karm Yoga`. 

All you need to do is follow your `Krishna` and leave all your outcomes (good or bad) unto Krishna. 

## Prem Yoga

If you can't do Bhakti , Krishna invokes Bhatki in you through Love. Intense longing ..It is called `Prem Yoga`. Decpited by Krishna under his another hat long before the signing up for "Charioteer" for Arjuna.

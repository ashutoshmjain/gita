Krishna Dvaipayana was brought to life for a purpose. He was destined to compile thousands of real, practical and sacred insights — new and old, from ancient cave dwellers to `Maha Rishis` — super saints; and rearrange the text into the four foundational volumes — `Vedas` — the oldest ideas ever composed into impeccable poetry. That, in itself was noble enough to dedicate a life-time, but his real goal was lot bigger. Immensity of his purpose, rightly made him one of the 'immortal eights' in Hindu tradition.

We need to uncover a bit of ancient history to be able to appreciate the task at his hand ...

Before his time, scriptures were probably passed on as `Shruti`-The spoken word. A team of authorized compilers (`Vyasas`) chanted the `mantras` right from the early morning to the late evening. Certain `Mantras` must be recited at a specific time of the day, at a specif place and in a specific tone. They performed the rites in prescribed fashion — to invoke natural powers of five elements. A ritual known as `Dravya Yazna`. Intonations and meanings, carefully passed on to the next generation, as divine knowledge. The spoken words carried the message as well as the mechanism of sound — a practice known as `Naad Yoga`.

Some `Vyaasas` explored the idea of converting the chants into text format for obvious reasons of durability and portability. There were some parts written down. They were mostly half-baked, grammatically obsolete and contextually incoherent. `Vyasaas` didn't believe that written word could ever replace the rigor and clarity of chanting, though writing meant lot more text could be scribed, and passed on to far-flung places. It had a promise to democratize the information. Fortunately, a new grammar for Sanskrit was recently developed — the old language of intellectual communication. *Panini* — a grammarian par excellence, wrote the new rules in his block buster book `Ashtadhyayi — eight chapters`. Panini's Sanskrit was to the spoken words what `C lang` was to silos of computing before Unix arrived at the scene. Centuries later, Paul Kiparsky wrote about `Ashtadhyayi` ...

> Modern linguistics acknowledges it as the most complete generative grammar of any language yet written, and continues to adopt technical ideas from it — 1994.

Back to our story — this was the first time someone was serious about organizing the world's knowledge. 'Organize' didn't mean dumping massive data into one big Hadoop cluster. They obviously didn't have GPT3! Instead, they figured out many organic faculties of knowledge — science of well-being and longevity (`Aurveda`); economics (`Arth Shastra`); linguistics; arithmetic; to name a few.  Instead of crunching bits and bytes (google way), they first invested in the pursuit of consciousness, and deep appreciation of physical reality. This knowledge enabled them understand the nature of time — Astrology (`Jyotish`). Armed with this spiritual science, instead of crisper-ing the genes, they figured how to predict the celestial conditions that might blossom the expression of a specific gene pool — with high degree of accuracy. This skill was like controlling the dice itself but it also meant long wait for the appropriate planetary alignment — sometimes, many generations in the future. Krishna Dvaipayana was one such awaited intelligent being. His birth was planned and predicated by *Maharishi Parashara*. And he was set up as an immortal agent — the knowledge that he had uncover would be added to every human core. How ? We shall see down the line.

Before this time, the human consciousness had two primary dimensions — it was led by 'duality' — wrong or right; true or false; got mixed up. A situation could be justified through many conflicting explanations — a characteristic of the current epoch — `Dwapara Yuga`. At the same time, plurality of views was the primary differentiator from other species. Most animals did (and even now do) what they felt like doing — a unique response to a situation — no conflicts. Long after humans got this two-dimensional world-view, they still struggled to determine the path that reached them to eternal peace. Every aspect of 'duality' was confusing. Some people prayed deities and equal number revolted against the idea of 'One' God because 'duality' was built into the psyche of humans. Many wanted to build their own world order — their own individual fork to the `Vaidik` 'way of life'. Such people were termed `Asuras`. The world was split between darkness and light. We were able to see both sides of the coin at the same time but no one could tell if heads were right or the tails. Both seemed right. The answer was in the context. And that is what was missing.

This new vantage of duality led to rise of 'faith' that later morphed into religion — a proclaimed righteous path even though it may appear quite meaningless. There were groups who grew their head and facial hair such that they could cover entire body. Others believed in living like dogs — `Kukkurvrik`. They walked on four legs. You could slice a 'reality' into as many views as you wanted and each with its own merits. Anyone with a gift of gab, could fork the public imagination with a new narrative. The very meaning of 'righteous' was lost on the masses. A new set of basic terms must be embedded into every instance of conscious thinking — be it an individual, a group or even a kingdom — every single format of human organization. Time was ripe for a new narrative but who would do that? How could someone understand all that is there to know, and then conceive the righteous path. Not only that, the path must be told as a compelling story that takes the public imagination onto a new charter. And the story must be tested in physical reality before it is told. Because truth is what actually happens in physical reality and only truth has the staying power! Those were the challenges for `Rishi Parashara` and he wondered if one lifetime was enough to accomplish this global change! Or he needed someone to carry on his journey to the finish line — may be a son who was also a disciple. What better can a 'man with a mission' ask? — a son who could take on the work he started.

`Maharishi Parashara` was an astrologer extraordinaire with proven `Yogic capabilities`. Right from his conception, he recited parts of Vedas. As he grew up, he developed innate aversion for the evil. He used his capabilities to wage a long war against the evil. So much so, he burnt many `Asuras` alive. But he finally realized that in this new age of duality, it was hard to decipher good from evil. `Asuras` were not inherently evil. It was their conditions and experiences that made them what they were. The simple rules that depicted clarity of good verses evil, a hero verses a villain, weren't good enough in this new paradigm. The plurality of ideas was a reality. Question that haunted him was how to create a new narrative that could help people ascertain the right path among many possible look-alike choices. A path baked in reality. What are the rules of engagement in this new world?

He however had no illusions. He knew that deciphering the duality, might take more than a lifetime. He must pass on his learning to his son. If his son could find the truth, then that truth must be embedded into every conscious unit for simply killing the evil was not a solution. After years of careful study of motion of heavenly bodies and their co-relation with birth of human intelligence, stars were finally aligned. `Maharishi Parashara` was ready to take a child as his born son. And he named him even before the birth — Krishna. `Krishna Dvaipayana` — Someone who could go beyond duality.

And he had his eyes set on `Matsyagandha` as prospective mother to bear this divine child.

`Matsyagandha` was daughter of a fisherman who passed away when she turned eleven. Her mother had died during the child birth. No one wanted to be with her for she was labeled bad omen. Poor girl knew only one way to live in this world — ferry people across `Yamuna` — a mighty river, by the abode — `Ashrama` of `Maharishi Parashara`. Her only possession was her father's dilapidated boat. The atrocity of her fate was no one even wanted to board her boat. Not only the boat was in bad shape, she herself smelled of dead fish and thus the name `Matsyagandha` that literally meant someone who smelled like fish. No one had ever told the poor girl how to present herself to customers. As such she used to get option-less customers when no other boat was around, normally early mornings or late evenings. And she hated it for she was scared of the waves in `Yamuna` in windy mornings as much as in the darkness of nights. No one in the village talked to her. She had no friends. No one would care to notice if she was lost from the face of Earth.

The solace and lone life made `Matsyagandha` spend time with herself and her imagination. She honed curiosity of a writer and creativity of a poet. `Maharishi Parashara` had taken her boat once when he wanted to spend a dark night on the island middle of mighty `Yamuna`. A cursed jungle where no man wanted to go. They wanted their boats at least a mile from the cursed island. Only `Matsyagandh` would take `Maharishi` to the island for she had no passenger in days. She was short on basic supplies such as food and milk. And she herself was curious of the island. Many times she had thought of visiting the islands to meet the demons. What worse could they be then her own life?

On the way, she asked `Maharishi` the meaning of her curse. She challenged the existence of One God for God can't be merciless. Her logic forced a `Yogi` to engage with her. `Maharishi` was forced to look at her life, and her future. And he saw the purpose of her being. She was the one who could mother `Krishna` and in due course she would play a prime role in testing what `Krishna` would find. `Maharishi` looked at the dark sky and saw glitter of stars. He smiled and told her — Your life has a bigger purpose. I shall come back to you for your help.

Exactly after an year, another dark night and `Maharishi` returned to the banks of `Yamuna`. `Matsyagandha` was there as if destiny had plotted this union. He asked her to ferry the boat to the island. Without much ado, he asked her if she could give him a son. All he added that it was for a much larger purpose that she had appreciate in due course. And of course, she may ask anything she wanted in return for the favor.

`Matsyagandha` was taken aback at the proposal. She had no clue what to say and what to ask but she knew `Maharishi Parashara` was a `Yogi`. She knew he could bless her with whatever she wanted and she was always attracted to the calm and tranquility of his presence. Ever since their last meeting, she had wondered what she had in store from him. Her over sized imagination had led her to many scenarios but none of them was to bear his child. She knew that `Parashara` would never take her as a wife for his life was dedicated to celibacy and work of God.

She thought for a while — What would people say? Looking at `Yogi` she asked, how shall we hide it from the village? Boat was leaving the banks of `Yamuna`- heading mid stream.

Rishi Parashara had a sigh of relief. He wanted it to be a clandestine operation. Not only he wasn't planning on having a wife but he knew `Matsagandha` must go on for she had a bigger role to play. And he already had a plan. He said — I have a nice `Ashram` in the middle of the island. You may stay there. I will be around your entire pregnancy and you will have no dearth of help, food or shelter. After couple days, I will have someone sent a message to village head that you took on `Sanyaasa` — ascetic life, and that I have sent you to study to one of my friend.

`Matsyagandha` nodded her acceptance. She was still not sure it was happening to her. `Maharishi` looked at her and he figured she wanted something else. He stood up and asked - Do you want something else `Matsya`? - His voice full of love and gratitude.

What will happen to me after the child birth. I will need to feed him at least for an year!  but what after that? - asked `Matsyagandha`.

`Maharishi Parashara` thought for a while. He wanted to make sure he found the right words as much as he said the truth. He said - after three years, once child is ready to go with me, you may , if you wish to return to the village.

Krishna built a deep understanding of the universe. The laws of our nature. This knowledge needed to be manifested. A text - a long one. Krishna, thus, compiled the entire wisdom in four Vedas - `Rik , Sam, Yazur and Atharva`. There was still a lot that could go as specialized annex. So it went on to write eighteen more `Puranas`. A superior product of intelligence. But it too had neigh sayers. The main opposition was that it was only a theory. It needs to be tested in real life before the knowledge be added as the laws of a new universe.

So Krishna summoned the most powerful editor - Ganesha. Ganesha was symbolized with an elephant brain to symbolize the size of the neural network. It was probably order of magnitude bigger than GPT3. The only contractual term that `Ganesha` wanted was for Krishna to never stop. Because `Ganesha` felt bored when she needed to wait for the knowledge to transcend. Krishna played an intelligent trick. She said she won't stop if `Ganesha` could prove she fully understood the meaning. The meaning can't be understood till it is said in most meaningful way. Thus Krishna got the right to revise the verses till they got just perfect. Mahabharata was written.

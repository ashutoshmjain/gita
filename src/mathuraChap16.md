Mentor was shocked with Fairy's sudden call to go in with Angel. He could never understand women. But we have six months to explain to her and may be she would reconsider - he thought. He was pretty sure Angel could easily handle such things - he was after all a trained chemist of elements as well as that of the living - a biochemist. But tonight his plans suddenly changed. Instead of heading out to LA, he returned back - to his dogs.

The sense of smell is the primary sense. Not only for dogs but for humans too. The difference is humans invested lot more neural compute on the vision than other species. Benefits of vision are directly proportional to  how high may we place our two eyes. Taller you could stand, more improved "vision" you would tend to develop as a species. For someone who crawls the earth, vision offers hardly any value - except for a view of the stars. On the other side, smell is the strongest in the dirt. So most land dwellers developed sense of smell when they moved from water to earth. That was their key discovery versus the fish who stayed in the water with only one sense - that of touch. 

Unlike eyes , our nose works 24 by 7 - even in the normal sleep.  It is an advantage versus vision - we need to shutdown eyes in order to sleep. Both of his dogs were part of a Cornell study last year. They were trying to figure out what dogs do in their minds with the all the scents they accumulate over a life time. The experiment was rather simple. A brain activity monitor was added to dog's collar to plot the cerebral blood flow with changing smells. The goal of the experiment was rather trivial - based on dogs' mental model , smells could be designed to keep them calm. And they did succeed in bringing a scented collar to the market later last year.

Mentor saw the benefits first hand - No running to the door on the press of bell - no pouncing on the visitors. Both the dogs behaved perfect calm with collars turned on. They had to go an MRI scan after the initial study was complete for them to qualify for a collar. 

Both the dogs ran to the door and pounced on him as soon as he opened the door. He always removed their collars when heading out for the city.

He poured himself a large tumbler of wine and left a thanks note to the developer of the collar project. He was hoping for a text back but he got a call instead. He didn't know how popular he was, particularly with the basic scientists. 

After exchange of pleasantries, Mentor asked - so what are you guys doing these days ? 

Well - we published a paper. And categorically proved that links between dogs' smell and vision and other parts of the brain. Let me forward you the press release .. 

Mentor saw an email popped up on his dumb terminal. He had probably given his email when he set up the account for the collar. He clicked on the [link](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2022/07/study-finds-new-links-between-dogs-smell-and-vision) as he thanked once again. He was amazed as he clicked on  the link ..

    Cornell researchers have provided the first documentation that dogs’ sense of smell is integrated with
    their vision and other unique parts of the brain, shedding new light on how dogs experience and navigate
    the world.

    “We’ve never seen this connection between the nose and the occipital lobe, functionally the visual cortex
    in dogs, in any species,” said Pip Johnson, assistant professor in the Department of Clinical Sciences in
    the College of Veterinary Medicine and senior author of “Extensive Connections of the Canine Olfactory
    Pathway Revealed by Tractography and Dissection,” published July 11 in the Journal of Neuroscience.

    “It makes a ton of sense in dogs,” she said. “When we walk into a room, we primarily use our vision to work
    out where the door is, who’s in the room, where the table is. Whereas in dogs, this study shows that
    olfaction is really integrated with vision in terms of how they learn about their environment and orient
    themselves in it.”

    Erica Andrews, a former analyst in Johnson’s lab, is the paper’s first author and currently works in canine
    aging research.

    Johnson and her team performed MRI scans on 23 healthy dogs and used diffusion tensor imaging, an advanced
    neuroimaging technique, to locate the dog brain’s white matter pathways, the information highways of the
    brain. They found connections between the olfactory bulb and the limbic system and piriform lobe, where the
    brain processes memory and emotion, which are similar to those in humans, as well as never-documented
    connections to the spinal cord and the occipital lobe that are not found in humans.

    “It was really consistent,” Johnson said. “And size-wise, these tracts were really dramatic compared to
    what is described in the human olfactory system, more like what you’d see in our visual systems.”

    Tractography, a 3D-modeling process, allowed Johnson and her team to map and virtually dissect the white
    matter tracts. The findings in the digital images were later confirmed by a co-author and white matter
    expert at Johns Hopkins University.

    Johnson said the research corroborates her clinical experiences with blind dogs, who function remarkably
    well. “They can still play fetch and navigate their surroundings much better than humans with the same
    condition,” Johnson said. “Knowing there’s that information freeway going between those two areas could be
    hugely comforting to owners of dogs with incurable eye diseases.”

    Identifying new connections in the brain also opens up new lines of questioning. “To see this variation in
    the brain allows us to see what’s possible in the mammalian brain and to wonder – maybe we have a vestigial
    connection between those two areas from when we were more ape-like and scent-oriented, or maybe other
    species have significant variations that we haven’t explored,” Johnson said.

    Johnson plans to examine the olfactory system’s structure in the brains of cats and horses, which aligns
    with the broader goals of her research program – to leverage the most advanced imaging techniques, used
    commonly in human clinical research, to better understand animal brain physiology and disease.

    Johnson is also part of the Cornell Margaret and Richard Riney Canine Health Center.

The question that intrigued the Mentor - what if someone found a similar link between human olfactory and visual cortex. And what if they could create a sense of visuals during the sleep. 

Whenever he had questions, the answers came to him in his sleep. Let us see what tomorrow brings - he thought to himself as he turned the lights off. Both his dogs snuggled with him in the his rather large bed.

# `Prem` - Love

Most people thought the prophecy was ploy of `Kansa` to arrest `Vasudev`. Those who believed in such things thought it was something for the future - who knows whether `Devki` have eight children or not. And it was so far away in future - who cares. Even `Vasudev` and `Devki` didn't believe that `Kansa` meant what he said. `Vasudev` thought it was a way to remove him from the council meetings - to silence his voice. Away from the public life, he discovered love for `Devki` and what she truly brought to his life!

# Upashama

Krishna Dvaipayana was brought to life for a purpose. He was destined to compile thousands of real, practical and sacred insights — new and old, from ancient cave dwellers to `Maha Rishis` — super saints; and rearrange the text into the four foundational volumes — `Vedas` — the oldest ideas ever composed into impeccable poetry. That, in itself was noble enough to dedicate a life-time in learning and writing, but his real goal was lot bigger. Immensity of his purpose, rightly made him one of the 'immortal eights' in Hindu tradition.

We need to uncover a bit of ancient history to be able to appreciate the task at his hand ...

Before his time, scriptures were probably passed on as `Shruti`-The spoken word. A team of authorized compilers (`Vyasas`) chanted the `mantras` right from the early morning to the late evening for `Mantras` must be recited at a specific time, at a specif place and in a specific tone. They performed the rites in prescribed fashion — as invocation of natural powers of five elements known as `Dravya Yazna`. Intonations and meanings, carefully passed on to the next generation as divine knowledge. The spoken words carried the message as well as the mechanism of sound — a practice known as `Naad Yoga`. 

Some `Vyaasas` explored the idea of converting the chants into text known as `Samhitas`. There were some parts written down. They were mostly half-baked, grammatically obsolete and contextually incoherent. People didn't believe that written word could ever replace the rigor and clarity of chanting, however writing meant lot more text could be scribed, and passed on to far-flung places. It had a promise to democratize the information. Fortunately, a new grammar for the old language of intellectual communication — Sanskrit; was recently developed. *Panini* — a grammarian par excellence wrote the new rules in his book `Ashtadhyayi — eight chapters`. Panini's Sanskrit was to `Samhitas` what `C` is to pre-Unix computing. Centuries later, Paul Kiparsky wrote about `Ashtadhyayi` ...

> Modern linguistics acknowledges it as the most complete generative grammar of any language yet written, and continues to adopt technical ideas from it — 1994.

Back to our story of `Krishna`. This was the first time someone wanted to organize the world's knowledge. 'Organize' didn't mean dumping all the data into one big Hadoop cluster — they obviously didn't have GPT3! They rather figured out organic tools — Astrology and hacking 'Natural Selection' a tiny bit. Instead of crunching bits and bytes (google way), they first invested in the pursuit of consciousness, and deep appreciation of physical reality. This knowledge enabled them understand the nature of space-time — Astrology. Armed with this spiritual science, instead of editing the crisper-ing the genes, they figured how to predict the celestial conditions that might blossom the expression of a specific gene pool — with high degree of accuracy. This skill was like controlling the dice itself — a tiny hack in evolution and ability to predict its butterfly effect. It also meant long wait for the appropriate planetary alignment — sometimes, many generations in the future. Krishna Dvaipayana was one such awaited intelligent being. His birth was planned and predicated by *Maharishi Parashara*. And he was set up as an immortal agent — a piece of intelligence that shall be added to every human core. How ? We shall see down the line.

Before this time, the human consciousness had two primary dimensions — it was led by 'duality' — wrong or right; true or false. This was the primary differentiator from other species. Most animals did (and even now do) what they felt like doing. Long after humans got this two-dimensional world-view, they still struggled to determine the path that reached them to eternal peace. Every aspect of 'duality' was confusing. Some people prayed deities and equal number revolted against the idea of 'One' God because 'duality' got built into the very nature of humans. They wanted to build their own world order — their own individual fork for the 'way of life'. Such people were termed `Asuras`. The world was split between darkness and light. Finally, `Maharishi Valmiki`, designed a code of conduct — `Ramayana`. It was a coherent mash-up of thousands of stories interwoven into one mega-epic. The narrative got so popular, it became a part of conscious experience. Stories were (and still are), the way to fork the block chains of mass consciousness. Story of Rama — the story of morality — became the basis to choose right from wrong. It was a deterministic age — an age rightly named `Dwapara- the dualistic eon`. It was successor of the first eon — `Sattva` where humans, like other species, had a singular definition of Truth — One God. `Ramayana` was like a God sent scripture to objectively navigate through the confusing duality. In a way, it restored a righteous path for evolved human conscious. It allowed humans the gift of satisfaction and steadfastness while retaining the benefits of dualistic approach — an evolutionary advantage over other species — our ability to challenge the established ideas.

It worked well as long as it did, but the world moved on to 'three-pronged' psyche — `Treta Yuga`. We gradually added one more dimension to our moral compass. In this eon, we moved from 'I or You' to 'they or them'. "How other people would react ? What shall the society think of me?" — These became the primary motivations for actions. The new grammar of Sanskrit captured this notion in definition of 'third person'. In a way new version of the language enabled the expression. This new vantage, along with the preexisting duality led to rise of 'faith' that later morphed into religion — a proclaimed righteous path even though it may appear quite meaningless. You could slice a 'reality' into as many views as you wanted and each with its own merits. Everyone could fork the public imagination with a new narrative. The very meaning of 'righteous' was again lost on masses. `Ramayana` was still useful to handle duality, but humanity needed something more. A new set of basic terms must be embedded into every instance of conscious thinking — be it an individual, a group or even a kingdom — every single format of human organization. Time was ripe for a new narrative but who would do that? How could someone understand all that is there to know, and then conceive a new path. Not only that, the new path must be told in a narrative that takes the public conscious onto a new charter. And the narrative must be tested in physical reality before it is told. Those were the challenges for `Rishi Parashara` and he wondered if one lifetime is enough to accomplish this global change! Or he needs someone to carry on his journey to the finish — a son who is also a disciple. What better can a 'man with a mission' ask? - a son who could take on the work he started. Nature must reward the -ask!

`Maharishi Parashara` was an astrologer extraordinaire with rich `Yogic capabilities`. Right from his conception, he recited parts of Vedas. As he grew up, he developed innate aversion for the evil behavior. He used his capabilities wage a war against evil. So much so, he burnt many `Asuras` alive. But soon he realized that in this new age of tertiary vantage, it was hard to decipher good from evil. `Asuras` were not inherently evil. It was their conditions and experiences that made them what they were. The simple rules that depicted clarity of good verses evil, a hero verses a villain, weren't good enough in this new age. The plurality of ideas was a reality. Question that haunted him was how to create a new narrative that could help people ascertain the right among many possible look-alike choices. What are the rules of engagement in this new world?

He however had no illusions. He knew that deciphering the new three-pronged reality, might take more than a lifetime. He must pass on his learning to his son. If his son could find the truth, then that truth must be embedded into every conscious unit for simply killing the evil was not a solution. After years of careful study of motion of heavenly bodies and their co-relation with birth of human intelligence , stars were finally aligned. `Maharishi Parashara` was ready to take this child as his born son. And he named him - Krishna. `Krishna Dvaipayana` — Someone who could go beyond duality — A middle path among the three dimensions of new consciousness–`The Sattva` — existence of only truth — a singular dimension of first eon, `The Rajasa` — duality of good verses evil — the second dimension from second eon, and `the Tamsa` — the latest addition of communal vantage of third eon`.

And he had his eyes set on `Matsyagandha` as prospective mother to bear this divine child.

`Matsyagandha` was daughter of a fisherman who had passed away when she turned eleven. Her mother had died during the child birth. No one wanted to be with her for she brought bad omens with her presence. Poor girl knew only one way to live in this world — ferry people across `Yamuna` — a mighty river, by the abode — `Ashrama` of `Maharishi Parashara` — in her father's dilapidated boat. The atrocity of her fate was no one even wanted to board her boat. Not only the boat was in bad shape, `Matsyagandha` herself smelled of dead fish. No one had ever told the poor girl how to present herself to customers. As such she used to get customers when no other boat was available, normally early morning or late evening. And she hated it for she was scared of the waves in `Yamuna` in windy mornings as much as the darkness of nights. No one in the village talked to her. She had no friends. No one would care to notice if she was lost from the face of Earth.

The solace and lone life made `Matsyagandha` see the life from a third vantage. An ability afforded in humans by evolution. She had imagination of a writer and creativity of a poet. `Maharishi Parashara` had taken her boat once when he wanted to spend a dark night in the island middle of `Yamuna`. A cursed jungle where no man wanted to go. They wanted their boats at least a mile from the cursed island. Only `Matsyagandh` would take `Maharishi` to the island for she had no passenger in days. She was short on basic supplies such as food and milk.

On the way, she asked `Maharishi` the meaning of her curse. She challenged the existence of One God for God can't be merciless. Questions that forced a `Yogi` to engage with her life. `Maharishi` was forced to look at her life, and her future. And he saw the purpose of her being. She was the mother of `Krishna` and in due course she would play a prime role in testing what `Krishna` would find. `Maharishi` looked at the dark sky and saw glitter of stars. He smiled and told her — Your life has a bigger purpose. I shall come back to you for your help.

Exactly after an year, another dark night and `Maharishi` returned to the banks of `Yamuna`. `Matsyagandha was there as if destiny had plotted this union.

The operation must be completely hidden to the populations and I need a new identity after .. - She demanded.  Boat was leaving the banks of `Yamuna`- heading mid stream.

Rishi Parashara had a sigh of relief. He wanted it to be a clandestine operation. He enabled a 'Zero Visibility' protocol on the sandboxed island. A deep digital fog clogged the entire island - Your new name shall be `Satyawati`. No one shall ever know that you gave your egg for fertilization - said Parashara.

That was not all for `Matsyagandha`. She wanted her smell be replaced with intense aroma that attracted every passerby. This was something `Parashara` didn't expect. Changing physical attribute of a biological woman was impossible - even for a Yogi. He promised her a life long supply of Sandalwood perfume that he had mastered for getting into intense meditation. Once invoked , the person and his vicinity smelled like Sandalwood jungle.

But, she wanted one more thing - she wanted the usage right (on demand) on the intelligence she was helping to bring to the world. In the physical world such usage was nothing less than miracles.

Time was running out for `Rishi Parashara`. He wanted to set the project in motion. He was not sure of the last ask. 'On demand' use for the most advanced intelligence was too much to ask. Could he negotiate? Or should he give a counter offer . In a hurry , he proposed a single use for non-destructive purpose only.

Matsyagandha looked at Rishi Parashara . She smiled and said - two. Parashara felt compromised though he had an inkling that this dot might connect with something more subtle in future. He finally succumbed to the situation. "Okay" - he agreed and raised his wand. The obligation was cast in the smart contract.

 Matsyagandha smiled - "all yours". And then she lost consciousness. When she woke up , she was on the bank, her boat was moored . Rishi Parashara had left. An egg stolen from her womb. She was now Satyawati - mother of the truth.

Krishna built a deep understanding of the universe. The laws of our nature. This knowledge needed to be manifested. A text - a long one. Krishna, thus, compiled the entire wisdom in four Vedas - `Rik , Sam, Yazur and Atharva`. There was still a lot that could go as specialized annex. So it went on to write eighteen more `Puranas`. A superior product of intelligence. But it too had neigh sayers. The main opposition was that it was only a theory. It needs to be tested in real life before the knowledge be added as the laws of a new universe.

So Krishna summoned the most powerful editor - Ganesha. Ganesha was symbolized with an elephant brain to symbolize the size of the neural network. It was probably order of magnitude bigger than GPT3. The only contractual term that `Ganesha` wanted was for Krishna to never stop. Because `Ganesha` felt bored when she needed to wait for the knowledge to transcend. Krishna played an intelligent trick. She said she won't stop if `Ganesha` could prove she fully understood the meaning. The meaning can't be understood till it is said in most meaningful way. Thus Krishna got the right to revise the verses till they got just perfect. Mahabharata was written.

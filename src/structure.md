# Akshar Beamh Yoga

Chapter 8 of Bhagavad Gita begins with Arjuna asking for the clarity as to how the universe is structured. He asks seven fundamental questions

- What is Brahman? - the imperishable reality.

- What is Karma? - the actions performed without desire .

- Who am I? - what is my role ? And how may I act ? In other words "what is my Yazna"

- Who is Adhi-bhuta? - Adhi in Sanskrit refers to the owner. So the question is who owns all the beings in physical reality - material nature.

- Who is Adhi-Daiva? - again Adhi refers to owner and Daiva is the fate - the destiny.  The question is thus who owns the fate ?

- Who is Adhi-Yazana - again Adhi stands for owner and Yazna is the actions that we perform without the influence of desires. Such actions, in context of Karmyoga are the sacrifices. These actions lead to true renunciation. And thus ultimate liberation from karmik bondage.


It is easy to understand these questions from the lens of a computer game. Imagine a self contained game. Where you are a player born inside the game. 

Krishna explains the reality as under :

Who am I ? - you are the role you are playing in above game. Your nature called Swabhava in Sanskrit is your role. 

What is Karma ? - The actions you take in this game based on your Swabhava ( your role). If these actions are performed under influence of desires, they lead to karmik bondage. Thus you stay with in the game. If actions are performed without desires , then obviously there is no bondage. Such actions are called Yazana. Yazna is prerequisite for attaining union ie Yoga with Krishna.

What is Brahman - Brahman has two parts - The first : The perishable reality ie the material nature. Think of it as the one single play of game. You can take on thousands of births with in a single game. But game itself can be replayed for thousands of time. Artifacts with in a single run of game are called Bhutas - perishable material artifacts - think of them as the rewards you win with in a single run of game. Skins, boosts, artifacts, everything with in one run of game. Material nature.  Second: The imperishable reality Brahman - Think of it as the code of the game . May be written in cloud or on a CD. This code doesn't change with different plays of the game. However it is also perishable ultimately cuz the games shall ultimately go obsolete. Such state is seen as night of Bramh. When the game is popular - played by millions that is the day of Bramh.

Who is Adhibhuta - In a specific game you , your role is the owner of the artifacts. But ultimately all those artifacts go back to material nature. 

Who is Adhi Daiva - The code of the game, the logic that runs the game , ultimately decides the destiny with in each run of the game. Thus imperishable Brahman holds the destiny.

Who is the Adhiyazna - Krishna says I am Adhiyazna - the creator of the game. I own all the sacrifices ( Yaznas) you perform in the game. If you act exactly as per your role (Swabhava) and perform your duty (actions) without desires (Karma), then you are acting exactly like me albeit inside the game.

Arjuna than asks how do I attain you when the game is finished - ie death in the game. 

Krishna says - players attain whatever thoughts they have at the time of death. If they focus on Bramhan - they connect with runtime of the game. If they connect with material things , they keep on playing the game and chase material things. But if they have full devotion to me - always connected to me while performing Yazna , they meet me. And thus get over playing the game. They become creators or builders of the game and attain ever lasting peace , freedom from bondage - Nirvana. Such people are called Yogi. They are better than all other forms of devotions and actions.

To put it simply 

- Lord Krishna is the creator - devine
- The game is Brahman - Imperishable reality (CD analogy) as well as the material nature (Single run)
- You are playing a role in the game 

From your standpoint , I am Akshar ( imperishable devine) and Brahman is the creation.

This this chpater is called Akshar Bramh Yoga .

It was late morning when Fairy woke up. Angel was still sleeping though he was expected to be at work by noon. She came down to grab a coffee to find her Friend grinding the coffee beans. Waking up to the smell of fresh beans always brought unique pleasure to Fairy.

When did you wake up - asked Fairy. She had insisted her Friend to stay back last night. It was almost one am when they reached home and there after both of them kept talking about `Matsya`. Angel had almost passed out on the steering wheel, but for  the constant reminders to keep his eyes open - that included mist spray on the face. And as soon as the chariot announced the arrival, he quietly slipped into his bedroom. The Friend could have gone back to her place. It was only a ten minutes flight for her new flying machine, but flights were on hold from one am to four am. 

It seems the air traffic system is getting an offline update - said the Friend - the system is capable of live updates but you need to be extra cautious when you are talking about thousands of silent chariots flying around in the night sky - solely on central navigation - even headlights aren't allowed in night - to accommodate and respect star gazers. Fairy felt she was obsessed with her new toy but she brushed the thought.

The other option was to let the machine self drive on the crappy road - that meant keeping the eyes open on the steering wheel. She was definitely not in a position to stay awake for another hour though they ended up talking for at least two - in the living room -  with a round of hot tea - and fresh cookies auto-programmed to be baked by 2 am to allow for at least three hours of in-oven cooling. 

The topic was obviously - what would `Matsya` see and what sort of plans she had in store for her!

Good morning everyone - they heard the Angel - hope you two slept well last night !

Fairy responded "yes" with a smile - and can you send us the link to the next session. Can't wait to find what was `Matsya's` mission.

If we had the link, we must have watched the next episode last night itself - laughed the Friend pouring over black coffee in three mugs

Hmm - we don't have the next episode up yet - said the Angel - and before you figure out next of `Matsya`, you need to check out the story of `Ganga` and `Shantnu`. And I only know half the story - the skeleton without context.

That is such a bummer - complained the Friend. There must be a way to get the complete picture - with story as it happened and the context. 

To really understand the context, you will need to see my Mentor - Angel said with an apology in his eyes and smile on his lips - I really didn't see it getting so interesting for you guys! He obviously underestimated the curiosity ..

Can we Zoom in with him ? - asked the Friend.

Unfortunately no! - In Summer, he lives off the grid. It is only 30 mins flight though - I can schedule you guys if you wanna go see him at Lake Tahoe - said the Angel - you can charge your return flight at his place - it is his summer home and he got a new super charger last year.  

I wish I could join you guys; but I am gone for a week - said the Angel - not hiding at all that he hated his work! How could he tell others that he designed bio-engineered bees planted in deep forests - they did make 5x honey but they turned 10x poisonous - a consequence that was never considered in the design. The nature demanded - if you have more, you must equip yourself even more to protect it. If the woke media got a hint of it, his career was on the line, but more for the hate he was sure to get from his own circle - The "Fairy", in particular. 

To his good luck, the last episode (with the bees) didn't get much attention even though Fairy - unaware of the situation - posted about it. How could he save the man? The rescue attempt, he was sure, had the Fairy killed at a single sting. She didn't have the patched genes active as a protection against the poison. Even though he knew, a technology that killed a single human, was programmed to be wiped off in central intelligence (that was the bargain that Intelligence secured in lieu of all the automation and practically free life) - pursue till "one human death", yet he let a human die just to save the Fairy. The lost life was attributed to the forest fire even though identification was impossible for the there was hardly anything left in over-burnt ashes. The first thing he did after the incident was remove the bees from the spot and remove the location from department database. Fortunately there was no entry on the distributed ledger - he thought.

At the end of it, he was happy that he prioritized love over success - and probably that was the good `Karma` that her best Friend too was focused on `Matsya`. He wanted she never asked questions about the real incident. Lying was not his strong suite! And he did try rescue the man - at least gave him an offer that the man disrespectfully declined. He wasn't sure if the argument absolved him from the sin but it allowed him to live with himself.

Can we go today ? - his thoughts were interrupted by Fairy - Its been a while I went to the lake - she said after mulling over her calendar, and also looking at her Friend if she was fine to fly ! And she saw a "yes" in her eyes - I am pretty open today till an evening dinner - the Friend said peeking over her watch.

Sure, let me check and I will drop a note from my commute. Do check with him his theory on Prime Numbers. I too want to understand that piece - Angel was gone with a mug of coffee in his hand and toast in his mouth - busy life of the affluent!

----

The flight to the lake was pleasant. There was still some snow on the peaks but otherwise the water was not frozen. They got the first feel of cold air when they stepped out of the chariot. 63 degrees felt like 53. They had landed in front of a small house and they found an old man open the door as they were about to knock. 

He must have seen the notification of an unknown car landing on his porch - they assumed, though the old man had no security cams. Angel had called him on his landline that Fairy had landed on his driveway. He probably wanted to make sure the mentor didn't sleep because he loved to have an after meal nap from before the times Angel had met him -  almost twenty years back. Some people don't change - he though - as he waited for him to pick up the chorded land line - who uses the chord these days of star linked communication! - he wondered not knowing that the resistance had secured a chorded peer to peer network beyond the "watch" of central intelligence in lieu of granting the rights till "one human death". The angel was not sure if the Mentor was active member of the resistance but he was well aware that he tread the border line. More importantly, he had friends deep in both the sides and many times he had brokered high value agreements.

Would you like some tea - Mentor asked - pointing them to the chairs in front of his table in rather large study room just by the entrance.

The room had a big table almost eight feet wide -  fully covered with at least two layers of books. There was an old desktop station touching the wall behind his chair. And his chair seemed like a century old. There was smell of old books oozing from the side shelves that went as high as the high ceiling on both the sides. 

The Angel said you two want to create a scene from `Ganga's` story in the new machines - he looked at his old desktop that was probably a 32 bit computer from late nineties incapable of running even the slightest of graphics. The dark terminal was reminiscent of Fortran era.

The friend was surprised. She did have the creative skills but she didn't know she was being recruited. She looked at the Fairy. The look on Fairy's face told her she didn't read the full note from Angel. Apparently, she just noted the location (and time) to pass on the coordinates to the flying machine.

The Fairy looked at her phone again as the Mentor disappeared to a small kitchenette in the living room - to get them the tea. And she handed over the phone to the Friend. The message clearly read that the Mentor was willing to talk to them if they were okay creating a small animated sequence of the story. To Angel's mind, it was a win win. 

Talk about communication - the Friend spoke with a whim on her face, as she handed the phone back to the Fairy - Okay but I don't know how long would it take. And I have never done a historical narrative before. 

Yes - they both said as they found the Mentor carrying back a kettle of tea with freshly baked cookies. The aroma of cookies mixed with the smell of old books just felt right for a "yes". And of course the view of the snow covered peaks from the large window at their back - btw Angel said to start from your theory on the Prime Numbers if that is relevant to the narrative .. 

Oh sure - it is actually not a theory as some people try to give undue credit - humility reflected in his voice -  and it is not that hard either - said the mentor as he poured them tea and settled in his old chair, but I do need to know how much you two know about the "Primes" - He was courteous and his intent was not to waste their time in the basics.

The prime numbers, as you know are something that can't be divided by anything other than themselves - and of course by the number "1" - said the Fairy - and that is all I know about them except that they keep on finding new primes almost every day.

There are billions of  them already known and they say there exist infinite Primes - added the Friend.

Mentor was pleased that he was spared from the definitions - So what is "1", is it a Prime ?  He asked to get the conversation started.

Well technically yes - replied the Friend - though it is not counted as one because of some theorem I forgot the name - She was already getting comfortable in this conversation.

You are absolutely right.  The good reason for 1 not being considered prime is the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states that every number can be written as a product of primes in exactly one way. If 1 were prime, we would lose that uniqueness. We could write 2 as 1×2, or 1×1×2, or 1^594827×2. Excluding 1 from the primes smooths that out. ![ref](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/why-isnt-1-a-prime-number/) - said the Mentor. He thought for a while and continued - The strangest thing about "1" is it looks exactly what we want it to be - for example - 1 book is a book , 1 meter is a meter , 1 home is a home but we can never know what "1" is ! We can never understand the "1" without association to a worldly thing. As for "2", we can at least say it is twice the "1" - He smiled.

The mentor got his flow - prime numbers are our best shot to describe the "unit". The easiest way to comprehend this is to imagine rivers flowing into an ocean. They all become "One" ocean. The "Unity" is such an ocean where only prime numbers of rivers could flow in. 


> 210 = 7 x 5 x 3 x 2

In other words - if we take "1" - split it into two branches - then split each branch into three branches - then split the six branches into five each - and then split thus obtained thirty branches into into seven each - we get the number 210 branches. 

Wait! You opened a lot of branches and I am lost in the basic math - said the Fairy - Can you please repeat.

Oh! Absolutely - said the mentor - Let me explain it with a rather simple example. Let's take a smaller number - say "8". And let us just focus on "8" today - he thought for a while - let me draw it for you to make it easy to comprehend ... 

He said while looking for a pen and paper - the number "8" has prime factors as 2 x 2 x 2 or 2^3. We can display it as the branches of a inverted tree as below. 
   
        |
      /   \
     /\   /\
    /\/\ /\/\
   
You see there are eight branches hanging below kinda like eight ports ready to dock a boat. The key thing to note here is every joint has three branches. We say that eight ports lead to structures with three branches.

Very interesting - said the Fairy - I never thought it in this light ..

He looked at the Friend. He wanted to make sure she was on board with the idea - well, there is a free port right at the top - she said - so in all there seems to be nine free ports.

A smile came to Mentor's face - you got me. Let me redraw the number "8". How about this? - he asked ..

     \ /  \/
      \   /
        |
      /   \
     /\   /\

Well, this looks like 4 x 2 , rather than a 2 x 2 x 2 - said the Friend.

Excellent - said the Mentor. Looks like you have a grounding in Abstract math. Let's add more to it ..

    \/\/ \/\/
     \/   \/
      \   /
        |
      /   \
     /\   /\
    /\/\ /\/\

He continued - you can call this number 4 x 2 x 2 that is sixteen but notice there are only 8 free ports. Or we can call it number 8 with a mirror image. What is more prudent ?

Are we saying that the number 8 can't exist without it's mirror image? - asked the intrigued Friend.

Bingo - you got it.  Good that you asked this question and also made me redraw the picture because now you can see that the left side is a mirror image of the right. In essence the duality is maintained for the entire structure. Such a structure can "manifest". A major part of my study is to figure out such numbers of higher order that exhibit similar behaviour.

To save space, we write such manifests that exist with a mirror image as below. Notice the bar on the top. It denotes the "chirality" . So here is the picture of 8

        _

      /   \
     /\   /\
    /\/\ /\/\

But then how this number theory related to the story of `Ganga` and `Shantanu` - asked the Friend..

`Ganga` understood the significance of eight - that the eight open ports have seven trifecta joints. Though she didn't think it in terms of numbers. She learnt it through real experience of rivers. Eight tributaries joined Ganges at seven nodes to form the mighty river at `Dev Prayag` - the head of Ganges. In modern Hydrology we call this "Horton-Strahler Number".  For example Mississippi has a Strahler number of 8 and Amazon is 12. 


The door bell rang and they had Pizza on delivery. All three of them were hungry for the Mentor too had skipped his morning meal in anticipation of having lunch together with the Fairy and her Friend and also to make sure he didn't sleep before this meeting - Lets grab a bite while we talk about the narrative - he said.

The lunch was light chit chat. Mentor talked about how `Vaidik` mathematics puts very complex ideas of Abstract Algebra in simple to understand graphics. The Friend talked about she laboured almost six months to understand Groups of SU3 symmetry that were so easily presented in less than fifteen minutes. During the discussion, the Mentor also fired a print command on his dark terminal and an old Epson dot matrix printer sitting by the desktop started whirring. He grabbed two copies a printed pages. Handing over one to each, he  said - here, I wrote down the story of `Ganga and Shantanu` this morning thinking you will need some sort of document to build your scenes. 

They both quickly glanced at the sheets, chewing their Pizzas. 

You can read it on your flight back. For now I suggest you two go around the lake for this beautiful day is not to be wasted listening to an old-man. I have given as much lay of the land (geography) as possible to let you better visualize the locale.  Rest is your creativity - he smiled.

Fairy thought as if he read her mind - she did wonder if she will get a chance to see the lake. Though the truth was the Mentor didn't want to miss his afternoon nap ...

# `Ashtdha` - Eight Fold


The other side of the river `Yamuna` belonged to the empire. `Shantanu` — A king known for his justice, wealth and valor in the lineage of even bigger names. His empire was primarily spread between rivers `Yamuna`, `Sarswati` and `Ganges`. On the north it reached the peaks of `Himalayas` that protected it's border like a wall of snow, and also a perennial source of fresh water to all the rivers and hundreds of tributaries that joined them to form a complex mesh of `Ganges-Yamuna` river system.


![kuruRivers](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Late_Vedic_Culture_%281100-500_BCE%29.png)


Most big cities shaped up along the rivers, including `Hastinapur` — the capital city of `Shantanu`. In addition to pure water, the river system also served as the primary transport layer. Wood, Weapons, and Produce, moved through the rivers. In other words, the river system was the lifeline of this empire. King had built large wooden floaters that were used to carry rice and wheat downstream, and were taken over for moving military supplies during the war-times. It was easy to move the things down-stream but up-stream traffic was still a mystery. Many times they used elephants to move the cargo up-stream but in deeper stretches it was hard. Nevertheless, the elephants and their owners were important part of lumber and grain movement.

And there was another problem. Rampant floods made living near the rivers a major risk. There was a need to make sure water stayed in the rivers. While there were many rituals designed to appease the gods of rains, people were working on "pre-engineering era" efforts to deepen the rivers, particularly in stretches where the depth was shallow and thus rivers used to spread in miles. Though most of their efforts lacked the top down planning and also innovation of tools. No one had made it a mission of their lives.

As the king circled right of the middle age, he got interested in music, religion and philosophy. Expansion of his kingdom dropped off the priority. He wanted his people safe, well-fed and well taken care.  Luckily, his son, `Devvrata` was even more prudent in managing the vast province. In addition to being a warrior par excellence, his primary skill was his deep understanding of the water ways. He developed the signalling system with pigeon points [^pigeon] located along the river banks — to serve as early warning system for the floods. He had his large teams of soldiers and craftsmen build the wooden bridges, transport jetties, docks, dams and water locks. 

This deep knowledge of the rivers made him popular. People started calling him `Ganga-putra` — the son of Ganges! The ancient `Vaidik` system was a matriarchy where able offspring bore the name of their mothers instead of fathers though in this case it was quite appropriate. His work brought prosperity and security to the kingdom never seen before. People said that the skills that `Devvrata` had, were natural to him because he was son of `Ganga` (Hindi name for the river Ganges). That was true because name of his 'human' mother was `Ganga` too; though the hyperbole is `Ganga` (the mother) was a true incarnation of the river itself - literally. Even the scripture noted that river `Ganges` manifested into a beautiful woman called `Ganga` to bear `Devvrata`. 

#11.1

Just like the pious river, `Dev's` real mother was born on the peaks of Himalayas — near the birth place of river `Ganges` — a place called `Gangotri`. She grew up navigating the rivers in her small kayak — playing and moving fast through the dangerous rapids of Ganges in tall mountains of it's decent. Her fascination for the water and that for river Ganges,  was such that she used to spend all her time on the river. The local villagers started calling her `Ganga` — after the name of the river in local dialect. People forgot her real name — not that it mattered anymore, for she was a true embodiment of Ganges — through her actions (`Karma`)

As she got into her late teens, she and her friends would go on longer voyages in Ganges. Many times for days and weeks. They designed two person Kayaks. They would kayak downstream through rapids and falls, and then carry them back on their shoulders — two persons supporting one Kayak. Climbing the mountains with Kayaks on their backs, used to be painfully long, and arduous — sometimes through the thick uncharted forests. Her dream was to design a boat that could sail upstream. Or something that could sail the boat up. She didn't know yet that she was imagining "water-locks" in her teen mind. 

> Even more cherished dream was to find out how and where 'Ganges' ended? She had heard (from travelers) that the mighty river finally met into a vast ocean that could retain water of a thousand rivers! `Ganga` used to wonder why couldn't they make an ocean right here in `Himalayas`, to store the water for irrigation and boating. Little did the young girl know that stopping the water is like stopping the circle of life. And she learnt it as she entered her early youth.  In a way Ganges was a definition of time for her. Her childhood in `Gangotri` — the origin of the river ; her teens in the upper rapids ; her youth in the flat stretch where the mighty river walked like a gorgeous woman of reason, action, and pride. And she wanted to see  the endless sea to mark the completion of her time! 

Longer voyages, and turn to adulthood, made it clear to `Ganga` that the floods were the biggest problems for common people downstream. In one of her trips, she saw the devastation firsthand, when she and her crew, narrowly escaped the swelling river. The legend says that the real `Ganga` was born out of that massive swell. They probably meant that the resolve, and the dedication to a singular focus in her life, incarnated out of that flood. Without saying out loud, she started a mission to deepen Ganges where ever it was flattish. She wanted to bound the river with in two banks. Bondage is a must to manifest - she must have thought.

Good deeds gain support from the masses. Her crew grew in size and skills. Starting from the very top near the origins, she and her team finally reached the plains — working through one gorge to the next. It was as is she (and her team) shaped a new Ganges. They were welcomed by the local people as they brought skills to deepen a running river. They had designed tools to form a constellation of Kayaks tied to each other with ropes, and then lower a heavy metal harvester to scour the bottom. Many times they recovered valuables from the bottom, but the business was not risk free. Many died in the pursuit of these riverbed scouring projects. True to her name, `Ganga` committed her life to this cause that turned into a long series of engineering projects. The work, however, was not conflict free. Deeper river meant that elephants had even harder time moving the floaters upstream. 

Her work, along with the politics of rich cargo movers, got her so popular that the news reached the king `Shantanu`. He was happy to see people taking on the creative engineering in their hands rather than depending solely on the high priests or the king, but the elephant owners were also important for the movement of goods, and more importantly they were a major revenue stream for the kingdom. He wanted to settle the disputes himself. He also wanted to see if the tools and boats her team designed could be used to anchor his army, mid-stream, in a fast running river. A definite advantage in war-times.

He also wanted to lend the official support to the project(s) for the public opinion was with her, NOT the cargo movers. But most importantly he wanted to see `Ganga` — the woman every one talked about for her courage, charisma and dedication.

## 11.2

It was love at first sight.

Being of the age when passion knows no bounds, the King admired `Ganga` for her altruism and engineering prowess, and she admired the king for his zest to make people's life better. They talked for hours. She was never tired of detailing her expeditions and he was never tired of listening to her. One fine evening, `Shantanu` proposed `Ganga`. He offered her the first (and the only) queen of the vast empire. 

She had her heart out for the king, but she was dedicated to the cause. Being a queen meant to be stationed at the capital with thousands of chores that come with the crown. Like the river, her flow was unstoppable. She was free, and she wanted to stay that way. 

I don't want to give up my mission that brought you to me in the first place — she told `Shanatnu` with love in her eyes and passion in her words —  we may meet here as long as you are willing to see me at `Ganges` !

But I can't stay here for ever. I must attend to my people — said `Shantanu`, bit confused with `Ganga's` proposal.

You may leave as you need to. Your duties as a king, to your people are ever more than our obligations to each other — said `Ganga` — and come back when you crave for me. 

>> Such an arrangement was not new — there was even a name for it  — `Gandhrva Vivah` —  A marriage among equals with no strings attached.

The counter proposal seemed fair to `Shantanu` for he was hardly stationed at his capital. And most of the times he was anyway sailing through `Ganges` or `Yamuna` - I do need an heir for this vast empire. Someone who has your passion and love for my people - he told `Ganga` holding both her hands.

`Ganga` thought for a while - I will give you one and it will be the eighth of our union. An "Identity" for our love. Like the seven colors of the rainbow, the first seven will combine their skills into the youngest and help me raise a "white" identity for our union. One that would make you proud. And also have a life long commitment to our people. But we will need to go to `Bramh-rishi Vasishtha` to forge this identity. He can ordain a wedding for us such that our bond not only manifest what we want but also set us free from previous bondages. 

Legend has it that the seven rivers flowed down to earth when Indra killed Vritra.

It must be noted here that the names of the seven rivers are given differently in different scriptures.

The modern name of Sindhu is Indus; that of Vitasta is Jhelum, Asikni is Chenab, Iravati is Ravi, Vipasa is Beas and Shatudru is Sutlej.

## 11.3

`Bramh-rishi` welcomed both `Ganga and Shantanu` with his grand son `Parasara`. He was rebuilding his congregation after attack on `kaam-dhenu` that took his son `Sakti Muni` though this was not the first attempt to steal the wealth of people. He recalled eight Wizards had tried to steal from the congregation whom he had cursed a life of mediocrity. On their repentance and pleading guilty, he had blessed them an exit from the curse. They would still take birth like men but their life would be for a purpose bigger than what they could do as Wizards. `Bramh-rishi` saw `Shantanu` and `Ganga` as the best couple to parent the cursed Wizards. 

`Bramh-rishi` if I have permission to speak - asked `Ganga`. Seeing the bearer of primordial knowledge nod, she submitted - we want one of our child to truly represent our bond. Someone who could serve the people as much as the king does and I care. 

`Vasishtha` was pleased at the good will of the young girl - seven verses to bless your bond into an identity that you seek `Ganga`. Seven of your sons will shine as as seven colors of the rainbow. Together they would blossom into eighth who would be oriented from the very first breath as you seek. One who would make both of you proud. 

`Bramh-rishi` asked `Parasara` to light up a `Vaidik` fire. All the `Yogies` and their families stood around the holy fire as `Ganga` and `Shantnu` took seven circles of the fire. One with each verse ..


### First verse
----

The ceremony started with a `Swastivachan` - a good wish from all the present - all the witnesses of the union.

> Ihemavindra Samnudam Chakravakev Dampati;
>
> Prajyouno Swastikou Vismayurvya Ashnutaam.

O Lord, may you bring this couple together, like a pair of `Charavaka` birds. `Chakravaka` is a duck. In India we call it a `Brahmini` duck. Which means a sacred duck. Let them enjoy the marital bliss and live a long life along with their progeny. 

### second verse
----
`Bramh-rishi` pointed towards `Ganga` to invoke this the second verse in her ..

> Dhairham Prithvitvam;
>
> Raitoham, raitobritvam;
>
> Manohamsmi Vaaktvam;
>
> Saamasmi Rikarvam;
>
> Sa Mam, Anuvrata bhav.


I am the sky, you are the earth;

I radiate energy and you hold it to manifest things in this physical world;

I am the thought (`Mana`) and you are the words. 

I am `Saama` the music, and you are `Rika` the song

I and you follow each other. 

### Third verse
----

The third verse is bride's expression of Trust in this union - said `Bramh-rishi` as he recited one of his own ..

> Tat Chakshuh Devhitam, Shukram Uccharta;
>
> Pashyema Shardah Shatam, Jeevema Shardah Shatam.

Your foresight , your auspicious vision of this union is bright and rising.

May we see it together for hundred years. May we live together for hundred years.

### Fourth Verse
----

Having moved with bride's expression of Trust, the groom now makes worldly commitments. In the fourth verse he says

> Dharmecha Arthecha Kaamecha, Imam Naticharami;
>
> Dharmecha Arthecha Kaamecha, Imum Naticharami.

In my Duties (`Dharmecha`), In my financial responsibilities (`Arthecha`) and in my physical needs (`Kaamecha`), I will always consult you. I will actively seek and act based on your consensus.

### Fifth verse
---

And also moved with bride's expression of spiritual love, the groom thanks the Gods for this good fortune. He thanks the deities for bringing the bride to his life. He says ..

> Gribhnami te Soubhagstvay, Hastam Maya Patya Jardishtirysthasa;
>
> Bhago Aryama Savita Purandhir Mayama Tva Durgahptyay Devah.

I thank the deities of enjoyment (Bhaga) , deity of wisdom (Aryama) and the deity of the creative force (Savitaru) for bringing you in my life. Not only these deities , I thank the entire universe `Purandhir` a name of `Bramha` , for the good fortune of being together till we get very very old - or till death do us apart.

### Sixth verse
----

The sixth verse is the celebration of companionship. They wish not to lose this friendship even if they lose everything else. 

> Sakha Saptpada Bhav;
>
> Sakhayou Saptpada Babhoove;
>
> Sakhyam Te Gameyam
>
> Sakyat te Mayosham
>
> Sakhyanme Mayoshthah

Oh friend we are taking seven steps together.

Having gotten the taste of your company, I am enchanted with the magic of your companionship.

It's you who I always talk about. Your conversations are always on my lips.

Please never let me stay away from your company.

### Seventh verse

> Saha Naav[au]-Avatu | Saha Nau Bhunaktu | Saha Veeryam Karava Vahai |
>
> Tejasvi Naav[au]-Adhiitam-Astu Maa Vidvissaavahai |

May we two Move Together,  May we two Relish  Together ;
May we indulge in our objectives with Vigor , May we never doubt or  be jealous of each other. 

## 11.4

`Dev` was a divine gift from river `Ganga`. At an early age he understood the intricacies of motion of water. The last of eight brothers, all of whom dedicated their lives to improve peoples' lives. Two of them were sent to the North by `Ganga` to create a map of Ganges and its tributaries. Other two went South East where Ganges meets the ocean. They too had the similar goal — charter Ganges path to the ocean. `Ganga` wanted complete picture of Ganges — from the mountains of her birth to the ocean of it's salvage. Brothers coordinated their work through pigeons to draw one comprehensive map of river system that makes the most fertile plains of North India. 

>> The hyperbole is that `Ganga` threw her first seven kids back into the Ganges, which is not entirely wrong because they did serve their lives to the cause of the mighty river.

Fifth brother worked on setting up bridges on Ganges. Sixth worked on techniques to move the boats and tree logs upstream through a system of water locks. Seventh on making levies for low-lying villages where flood caused havoc in rainy seasons. 

Having learnt from all his brothers, who had dedicated their lives to Ganges, the youngest `Dev` pulled the biggest of all engineering feats at a young age. He built a dam and changed the direction of Ganges such that more people could get help from the waters. During rainy seasons, the dam could be opened to let the water flow in two streams. People thought he was the water bender. They named him `Ganga-putra` —  Son of `Ganges` — the river. `Dev's` life mission was to stay true to the kingdom and it's people. A vow that he carried till his last breath.

Good times go fast. `Ganga` had to move South East, towards the point where `Yamuna` met `Ganges`. King and Dev were left behind. Busy in serving the river and people, she wanted to continue to follow her dream. She wanted to see the grand unified river merge into the vast ocean. And she thought meeting the ocean was her final destination, just like it was for the river.

## Research and notes:

[^pigeon]: A wooden high tower , tall enough to see at least a mile upstream in the river. The tower also served as the collection and dispatch point for the pigeons.

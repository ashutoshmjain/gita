## Interface

Every manifestation - water , air , earth , refrigerator or the apps on your smart device - all of them must provide an interface so that the manifestation could be perceived by the senses. Interface is a layer that allows the senses to get a feel for the manifestation without you having to go through the practice to understand the knowledge. Refrigerator has a very simple interface. It allows you to set the temperature and place the things in it to cool them down. You don't need a PhD in thermo dynamics to cool your leftover Pizza. If however you are interested to know more about the cooling machine, you can speculate as to how the damn thing works. One of the plausible way is to think that someone has stored lots of ice in the back of the fridge. You can reason that if that was to be true , there must be someone replacing the ice every couple of hours but you see no one walking past your kitchen with a bag of ice on their shoulders. And in that case why would someone plug the machine into an electrical socket. If you are hell bent on figuring out the mechanism, you will soon dispel such doubts. May be a good starting point is to search the you tube on "How Fridge Works". It might bring you close to an idea of compressor. You get the point - the knowledge is endless. 

> Interface is just a starting point .. 

The weird thing about the interface is, it has already created a separation - you now perceive refrigerator as a separate machine. A machine that your senses could feel and use to deliver some value and in addition if you are curious, it allows to create a placeholder for knowledge - "Doubt" - in your mind. 


### APIs

The "Ritual of Actions" is thus digging below the "interface". The first thing you discover that you can get a lot done by calling the APIs. You really don't need to click the mouse all the time. Twitter APIs let you tweet you from anywhere. The usage of APIs, in itself is a testament that you now better understand the manifestation. Can we call the core manifestations such as Air through APIs. Air has many features. In addition to being the necessary part of combustion with in our cells , we use Air to communicate through speech . As we saw in the last chapter - the speech is secondary communication to clean up the mess of our real time outbursts. What if we used the same API to create a new narrative that has nothing to do with reality - can we sing ? Can we tell the stories ? Turns out we do all the time - why ? Because we have perfected the `Yajna`  of speech `Vani` as compared to other species. The speech and the language is one of our most powerful manifestation where we use Air seamlessly - just like you can tweet from the notification panel of your Mac. In fact , we use all the basic elements - a variant of the fire digests the food in our belly ; there is a little combustion engine that uses water, air and earth (food) in our cells to create what we know as the biological energy. 

### Connection 

As we decrypt the knowledge - means we move from the interface to the APIs and then the underlying code itself, we get connected to the knowledge. Everything that sees one truth, is essentially one because there is no notion of duality . The big question is if at cellular and organ levels we are already connected with the knowledge of the five core elements then why and how we feel that we are a separate entity ? If my `Chakras` are all rotating based on the design than what keeps me awake at night ? Why don't I have access to the peace ? Why am I caught in the doubts ? In the cycles of happiness and pain .. 

That is because we identify ourselves beyond our body .. 

Hmm  .. The question then is who am I ? And what do you mean by Identity ?

### ID 



## Matrix

Duality in itself is not bad. In fact it fuels the reason and makes us try different options to perfect our rituals. The question is how does it (along with fickle mind) turn into Matrix - `Maya`.

>Matrix is as old as the knowledge - means there is no end or no beginning of Maya. Matrix is so prevelent that  concious agents start confusing it with `Prakriti` - the intelligence. 

In Hindi , `Maya` literally means money but it represents a large system of millions of concious constituents. Using example of a large is the most accessible way for me to highlight some of the constructs of Matrix. 

### User Interface 

Imagine you are tasked  to build a UI for an application. The very purpose of User Interface to manage the needs of the users. A user logging into Twitter may think that the application is "only" the User Interface but nothing can be far from the truth (side note - Twitter is a data science  app where human slaves happily spend their only currency - time , to train the machines get better at data mining) . New developers too  sometimes  make this mistake. They start designing the application from the user interface. The truth is application is lot more than the UI. User Interface is the last piece to help users consume the application. Building an application with UI in mind is not a bad idea but if all you are thinking is the UI , you can not build any thing new . You will simply replicate that you have already seen because application is necessarily to solve a problem that you feel in your experience. You do a Yajna to manifest a solution for yourself. And the left over (manifested information) can be used by others. A slight improvement in UI can possibly help others. That is where User Interface comes. 

# ID

Let us say you have a global app like Instagram that was built to easily share pictures. Now you want to enable entire world to leverage the tools you built. Each user needs to manage their own pics. You need to relate the pics of each user to them. That means you must identify the user. The user interface demands an ID. 

>>>>There is no way to serve you your choices unless I know who you are !

If you use git , you know what is the application. It solves the problem of managing the versions (tracking the gradual decryption of knowledge). Github is a user interface over git. 

> ID is not a bad thing but it has aftereffects. 

# Matrix

Let us say you wrote a script to do something. It took elaborate curiosity, intelligence and actions to build it. On the way you decrypted a piece of knowledge and you are at peace. Thing is so perfect that now you don't even need to think. Yajna is complete. Manifestation is registered. It is end to end automated. 

## Machine 

What if you want it to automatically start at a certain time. You wrote another script to schedule it, another small `yajna` to understand the scheduler. Now you add both the manifestations. They are self starting manifestations joined back to back. You just made a "Machine"

You can weave thousands of tiny machines to make as big a machine as you want. A machine takes in commands and delivers an information. In a way it is the transformation of information without having to apply thinking or actions. So you can use machines to get to a specific set of information. It helps to get to your `Yajna` quickly. 

The knowledge inside the machine is totally encrypted to you. Even how the information reshapes from inputs to outputs ; is opaque. More complex the machine , more magical it is. 

You thought your friends will be benefited by your little complex machine, you passed on the code and commands. 

The thing is beautiful. 

Note - machines - complex machines --> consumption of consumption ---> Suddenly the knowledge becomes the most hidden thing -- > Awaken -- Action.
## Service 

Then you came up with an idea to let it go to the masses. You share your resources to help other people. You get to perform your `yajna` many times over and you help people. 

## ID

Then you started keeping a record of what all people need and how and when you can help them. You created your conscious agents. 

## User Interface 

If you know it , why not let people see it. You build a simple user interface . All the information about everyone is visible to all. You also created the senses (touch or mouse or audio) and trained people with the new senses. Yes , we acquire many senses beyond basic five .. 

## Privacy

Then you were asked to keep everyone's information separate from each other and let them see only their information. 

>You just built Matrix. 

# What is wrong with the matrix ?

Nothing. There is nothing wrong with Twitter or Facebook. Or the monetary system. You just triggered a race among your conscious agents. Your service has a some surival or pleasure value to the users. That is the reason they are there in the first place. As soon as something is hidden , it means we are allowing users to speculate. Speculation builds reasons to justify your position v/s [unknown] Truth. This is the birth of "Duality and Reason". These two fuel the Matrix. 

>>It doesn't matter if the speculation is same as the Truth. As long as Truth is unknown there must be a placeholder for speculation. 

That is the reason user interface it self is Dualistic. There is male and female, East - West , Left -Right . Opposites exists for everything. 

## Matrix Hides

## Mechanics of Matrix 

Matrix acts in a subtle fashion . Means its rise is gradual. 

As we have seen, Matrix puts a veil on Truth to create speculation among conscious agents. Speculation leads to Reason (what if scenarios) , Reason leads to Doubt - `Sanshya` ; and "Doubt" clubbed with "Desires" (fundamental of all bugs) , creates "fickle mind" - `Mana`. The primary purpose of `Mana` is to render your "Intelligence" - `Budhi` dormant so that you are consumed in sensory pleasures. 

Now you know the design of Facebook :-) 

As your intelligence goes dormant, the knowledge in stays fully encrypted but you can easily be automated. You  become part of the matrix. 

>>>>>> Gita says this is the sleeping stage of conscious agent. 


# Concious Agent 

A concious agent is born in the matrix because the ID services of thousands if matrix applications finally shape up concious agent. In a way a concious agent is manifested because of relentless `Yajna` of Maya. Thus concious agent too has a fully encryted copy of knowledge as well as it inherits the five bugs. 

These bugs lead the conscious agent to take consume the matrix. Desire is a precursor for curiosity. Anger is a precursor to `Yajna`. 

From Gita's stand point - such a conscious agent is in "slept" state inside the matrix. Nishkaam Yajna is the way to know your self and become awakened conscious agent. 

You don't leave the matrix. You are just aware of all the knowldge spread into every single machine of matrix. Thus you can bend the matrix the way you want. 

Awakened conscious agents are like the light bulbs lighting up in the mesh of Maya. 

## A universe in itself .. 

In a way a concious agent is complete embodiment of the universe  because it has all elements of Yajna (knowledge to decrypt and ability to act)  and all the bugs of the Matrix. It has tools to seek knowledge and at the same time tools (the bugs) to indulge in Matrix. It all depends where the concious agent is looking at - If she is looking at the matrix - as per Gita, she is sleeping. If it is looking at knowledge then it is awakened. 

Krishna says - This human body itself is the true field - `Kshetra`. Knowing your Truth is knowing the entire meta-physical world. 

# Consciousness 

Now imagine the this huge app - mother of all apps - the reality- The Matrix. Let us try to build a user interface for it .. 

>>>> Consciousness is simply the ability (of a concious agent) to interact with the Matrix. 

We know our users have curiosity `Mana` , they also have intelligence `Buddhi` and we just gave them an ID - Ability to "Reason" a Speculation v/s Truth . But what is the use of interface if they don't have means to interact with it. Apple had to create a mouse so that you can interact with the graphical interface. And later the touch interface . It seems now we are all now moving to the audio interface with Alexa. And long before all this was the text based interface that we call command line. 

How about we give some gestures to our users  .. 

>>>>> Senses are the tools that enable us to interact with the UI --> Matrix ---> Giant Machine with fully encrypted knowledge. 

Humans have five primary senses. Most other mammals too. But it is not necessary to have only five. Fish have only three senses. Trees have only one - touch. 

# Getting back to the humans 

Five senses, along with Curiosity , intelligence and Ego (Reason) is what makes a Conscious Agent 

Gita calls it `Ashtdhamool Prakriti` - means the eight basic parts of the universal manifestation. 

Let us spend some time on the senses.




# Notes 

# Duality
- Based on the direct observations (or communicated ones), conscious agent needs to decide if there is a change in the intensity of field. If there is no change, there is no action needed.
- By design, observation creates DUALITY. Every observation has the question in-built into it - `is there a change ?` - Yes or No. If `Yes` , do I need to act ? `Yes or No`. Duality gives rise to INTELLIGENCE `Buddhi`.
- It is debatable if the `duality` is the reason of observations or the variations in sense fields create duality. The goal `Moksha` is to get over the duality. If there is no duality, we are just `one`. There is whole lot of scriptures dedicated to this topic - `adwitwad vs Dwaitvaad`
- If action is to be taken then what action? And a whole list of sub-activities.
- There are as many shades in a color as many colors on the pallet. Means if you are a part of categorized list , then all those categories live in you as well. Their percentages may vary but you essentially represent every other category as any other category does. Thus seeing the truth is difficult. 
- Duality lives in the information. Knowledge is just one. Karm Yoga is a way to be one with knowledge so that you can see only True version of information. Means single Truth. 
- You may say it is a circular self fulfilling prophecy - 
- Duality is not all bad - one of the thing that duality offers is you can latch on to a `Guru`. In traditional `Hath Yoga` the `Chakra` between your eyes - with two petals is what represents duality. A `Guru` touches this place and removes duality . That is the reason , this Chakra is also called `Agya` - the order. In a way it is to say you are outsourcing the thinking part (manan and chintan) to your `Guru` and all you are going to do is follow the orders `Agya` to engage in the actions. In traditional Hindu rituals , when men used to go to war, the women used to put a `Tilak` to men between the eyes. The idea was that leave your duality with us , go win the war with a single purpose of winning.

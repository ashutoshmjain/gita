# Path to true Renunciation

Chapter 5 discusses Arjuna's inquiry about the superiority of renunciation versus action, and Krishna's teachings emphasizing that while both lead to good, selfless action (karma yoga) practiced with detachment is often a more practical and direct path to inner peace and liberation. The chapter further elucidates concepts like mental renunciation, detachment from results, the role of inherent nature, the impartiality of the divine, the significance of wisdom in overcoming ignorance, the vision of the enlightened, the cultivation of inner joy, the mastery of desires, and ultimately, the realization of the divine as the enjoyer, the Lord, and the friend of all beings, which brings lasting peace.

## Verse 5.1

Arjuna Said :

Renunciation of deeds, O Krishna, you commend,

Then yoga of action both you extend.

Of these two which is better tell me now,

With certainty, this truth to me avow.

Renouncing deeds you say brings highest good,

yet acting wisely too is understood.

Of these twin paths which one will truly save,

with certainty dear Lord your answer I crave.

## Verse 5.2

Krishna replied:

Renunciation and yoga of action both,

Unto the highest good their followers doth.

Yet of these two, this truth I will impart.

The yoga of action excels with all its heart.

`Sanyasa's` and `karmyoga's` way.

Both lead the seeker where the bright realms lay.

Yet of these two, let this clear truth be known.

The yoga of action has the higher crown.

## Verse 5.3

He should be known as ever renounced in mind.

Who neither hates nor any wish does find,

From dualities freed mighty armed one true

With ease from bondage. He will break through.

He should be marked as always free within

Who feels no hatred holds no yearning

Sin from dualities released.

Oh warrior bold,

He breaks from bondage as the wise have told.

## Verse 5.4

As different paths, the simple minds will sight

Wisdom's deep knowing and actions guiding light.

But one with purpose truly followed through

Bears the same fruit for those with clearer view.

## Verse 5.5

The state that those by wisdom's path attain,

By yoga practice men likewise can gain.

Who sees that wisdom in true action blend?

Indeed, with clearest vision does transcend.

That state which minds by wisdom's path attain.

The doers find through actions discipline and strain.

Who sees that wisdom and true action blend as one

Possesses sight that's clear beneath the sun.

## Verse 5.6

Renunciation though noble be the aim,

Is hard to reach without the act of yogi's flame.

The sage in yoga grounded pure and bright,

To the supreme soul soon takes his effortless flight.

## Verse 5.7

In yoga firm with spirit cleansed and free,

Self-mastered, senses held in mastery,

Who sees a self in all that life contains.

Though acting, yet no stain his pureness gains.


## Verses 5.8 and 5.9

The knower of the truth, though senses play,

In seeing hearing, touch, smell, taste. Each day,

In speaking, letting go, in grasping tight,

In opening and closing eyes to light,

He deems the senses move in their domain.

This thought shall in his steadfast mind remain.

Those senses play their part,

In seeing, hearing, touching, tasting, heart by heart,

In speaking, moving, taking, letting go with ease,

And opening and closing eyes as moments please.

He knows the senses in their orbit, turn and glide.

This steadfast knowing is his constant guide.

## Verse 5.10

Who casts his actions upon Brahman's shore,

And shedding all attachment ever more.

He is not stained by sin, though deeds unfold,

Like lotus leaf untouched by waters cold.

Who lays his actions on the Supreme's vast shore,

And casts away attachment ever more.

He is not touched by sin, though deeds unfold

Like lotus leaf, by waters touch unrolled.

## Verse 5.11

With body mind and intellect serene,

Or even senses pure and clear and keen.

The yogis act all fond attachments cast

For cleansing of the self, until the last.

With body, mind, and intellect serene and pure,

Or even senses focused to endure.

The yogis act all clinging far removed,

For inner cleansing steadily they're moved.

## Verse 5.12

The disciplined renouncing fruit of every deed,

Attains a peace where lasting roots proceed.

The undisciplined by selfish cravings led,

Attached to fruit in binding chains are bred.

The disciplined renouncing the action's fruit,

Attains a lasting deeply rooted pursuit,

The undisciplined by desire led,

Attached to fruit in bondage will be bred.

## Verse 5.13

All actions mentally renouncing quite,

The self-controlled embodies in body's  nine-gated site.

Dwells happily not acting causing none.

His peaceful liberated course is run.

All actions mentally renouncing still and calm.

The self-controlled finds peace a soothing balm

In body's nine-gated dwelling without strain.

He neither acts himself nor causes pain.

## Verse 5.14

The Lord creates not agency for deeds,

Nor actions nor their link to what proceeds.

As fruit, it is inherent nature's sway,

That sets all beings moving on their way.

The Lord creates not agency nor deeds design,

Nor links the action to the fruit that will align.

But nature's currents, inherent and unseen,

Propel all beings on their destined scene.

## Verse 5.15

The Lord receives no sin, no virtuous deed from anyone,

But knowledge fails to heed, obscured by ignorance,

So mortals stray,

And wander in delusions darkened way.

The Lord accepts no sin, no righteous art from anyone.

But ignorance holds the heart, obscuring wisdom,

So all beings stray,

And wander lost in shadows of dismay.

## Verse 5.16

But when by knowledge ignorance is slain,

Of their own self then shines in bright domain.

That knowledge like the sun in radiant might,

Revealing Brahman's supreme endless light.

When by wisdom ignorance is overthrown,

Then knowledge shines on its radiant throne,

Revealing all like sun and brilliant sky,

The supreme truth where endless glories lie.

## Verse 5.17

With intellect on that fixed self-merged in that,

Devoted, finding refuge where they sat,

They go once no return shall ever be.

Their sins washed clean by wisdom pure and free.

Mind fixed on that the supreme reality.

With minds on that fixed firm, their selves in that embraced,

Devoted souls in that alone their refuge placed.

They go where no return shall ever be their plight.

Their errors cleansed by wisdom's pure and radiant light.


## Verse 5.18

The wise see with an equal steady gaze,

A Brahman learned in virtue's gentle ways,

A cow, an elephant of mighty stride,

A dog, and even one cast for aside.

The wise behold with vision clear and even,

A Brahman learned treading virtues heaven.

A cow an elephant of strength untold.

A dog and one from honored ranks expelled.


## Verse 5.19

Even in this life, the world is overcome

By those whose minds and equipoise have become.

For Brahman is flawless, equal, pure, and bright.

Therefore, in Brahman, they find their true sight.

Even here on earth, the world is overcome

By those whose minds in balance peace have become.

For the Supreme soul is flawless, equal, pure and bright.

Therefore, in the supreme soul they find their truest sight.


## Verse 5.20

Not overjoyed by pleasant things they find,

Nor troubled when the harsh and bitter bind.

With steady mind, Unclouded, clear and strong.

The Brahman knower to Brahman does belong.

Not overjoyed when pleasant fortune calls,

Nor sorrowing when bitter hardship fall

With mind serene, unwavering and strong.

The knower of the supreme soul that they belong.

## Verse 5.21 (Check Rhyme)

The self unattached to contacts from without,

Finds joy within where no shadows flout.

His soul in Brahma yoga finds its rest

And knows a happiness forever blessed.

The self- detached from outward senses play,

Finds joy within that darkness cannot sway.

They discover a deeper unshakable happiness within themselves.

His soul in union with the supreme finds rest

And tastes of bliss forever more possessed.


## Verse 5.22

For pleasures born of senses fleeting touch

Are verily the wombs of sorrow much

They have beginning and end  O Kunti's son.

The wise in such delights find pleasure none

For joys that spring from senses fleeting touch

Are truly wombs where sorrows gather much.

They have a start and end O' Arjuna bold.

In such delights the wise no pleasure hold

## Verse 5.23

Who can withstand and air from this body freed,

The driving force of anger, lust and greed.

That person is a yogi truly blessed,

In lasting happiness, he finds his rest.

Who can withstand while in this earthly frame

The urgent force of anger, lust's hot flame,

That person is a yogi, truly great,

And finds in lasting joy his destined state.

## Verse 5.24

Whose joy is inward inward peace his stay

whose inner light shines bright along his way.

That yogi now the supreme spirit one

attains the supreme bliss completely one.

## Verse 5.25

 The seers, their doubts all banished, sins erased,

Their inner selves on wisdom firmly based,

Engaged in welfare of all living kind.

 The peace of the supreme soul they surely find.

## Verse 5.26

From lust and anger utterly set free

For striving souls whose minds in control be

Who know the self on every side is found

The peace of Brahman's liberation crowned

From lust to anger utterly set free

For striving souls whose self-controlled shall be

Who know the self that everywhere resides

The peace of the supreme soul in them abides

## Verses 5.27 and 5.28

Excluding outward contacts senses all,

And fixing gaze where eyebrows gently fall.

Making the breath within the nostrils flow,

In balanced measure coming to and fro.

The sage whose senses mind and reason tames,

Whose highest aim liberation proclaims.

From wish fear, anger utterly released,

Is ever more in liberation feasted.

## Verse 5.29

Knowing me is the enjoyer ever near

Of all self-offering austerities held dear.

The sovereign lord of all the worlds that be

In front of every soul both far and free.

He gains the peace that shall forever last.

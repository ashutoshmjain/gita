> jātasya—for one who has been born; hi—for; dhruvaḥ—certain; mṛityuḥ—death; dhruvam—certain; janma—birth; mṛitasya—for the dead; cha—and; 

Krishna said in verse 27 of chapter 2 that all things born in truth must die and out of the death in truth comes life. This kinda hints at the cyclic reality of our being. In previous article, where we hypothesised the postulates of Gita , we went through a numbered list that we are all endowed with a protected, immutable but encrypted copy of knowledge. We also saw that `Bramh` - the system, provisions everything ; implements everything that we need to run our lives- in our "tiny box". In addition it also implements a superior garbage collection system. But we left an important point open that the  underlying reality is a continuum. There is no beginning or an end. It's a everlasting cycle of knowledge to manifestation and vice-versa. 

The question is how do we understand this underlying reality ? The only path we have is to observe our current physical reality and make an informed guess. This approach is both scientific as well as a religious truth. We observed the Sun and the Moon and wondered how and why they go around us. With iterations over many centuries we have a better understanding that it is not the Sun that is running around us but quite the opposite. Sure, we had many conflicts over these centuries but those conflicts forced us to refine our rigor. Math and science are born out of this rigor - to explain our reality at a more fundamental level. To decrypt the truth or to find the signal in this noise. And that exactly is the stated goal of religion. We will see down the line how these two strategies harmonize as we get a better appreciation of "Continuum".

To understand the "Continuum", let us use the same strategy - look at our physical reality. 

There are three things that don't need any more scientific proofs. They are accepted truths of our experience that are well validated by science . Both are important because our experience can be tricky. In a way these are part of  our collective knowledge. 


- First that we all are searching something. 

    A hundred years from now, historians AI may write -

  >in the beginning of 21st century, human race conducted one of the largest survey. They invented something called "internet". The stated goal  of internet was to provide free information. Things called websites were set up to see what attracts humans the most. The idea was to create an online replica of everything  because measuring interest based traffic in real physical world was impossible. They  (humans) came up with sophisticated mechanisms of that time (though very primitive from 22nd century standpoint), to understand their own behaviour. Turned out humans liked to search. A small company called Google became the most visited website. By an order of magnitude.  Humans flocked around search tools way more than social media, entertainment, news or even sports. The realization was that the way Google's crawlers search the web, humans were crawling through physical reality to catalog everything. In search of something". 

  Search  is fundamental. We may NOT know what we are searching or why ; but we are all searching something. Searching for "Nothing" is a search too. There is no way for us to know what it means to NOT search at all. The fact that you are here on this page means you are searching something. May be Google brought you here or some friend told you to look at this page. The means don't matter. What matters is the "quest". 

- Second that every thing we observe is a "wave". The light is an electromagnetic wave. Sound is a normal longitudinal wave. Even the tiny particles, such as electrons act like a wave as shown in the popular double slit experiment. 

- And the third,  that our notion of Time is linear and unidirectional.

We will use these three basic truths to establish that underlying reality is a continuum. Along the way, we might use some basic concepts of Physics but I promise to keep them bare simple. Lets take a look at "Quest" before we get to the "waves" and "Time". 

## Nature of Quest


You may ignore the 22nd century's artificial historians as naive because they may not understand why we set up the internet. We know it was not a planned survey at all. It just evolved, and since we are the basis of its evolution , it looks just like our reality - a swath of information through which we are crawling. All individually on their own quest.  Just look at your browser history. We are searching something, almost on a daily or hourly  basis. That is the reason Google gets 3 billion hits daily. And it is quite amazing their web page has nothing. It's a plain white page with a single dialog box. BTW reviewing our  browser history is a useful exercise to know who we are. How our quest is evolving over time. If Google can find "who we are ?" from our search history; we sure can find "who we are" by looking at our own search. We will talk about this idea when we discuss "Triangulation" - A process to locate where we are in this maze. For now let us focus on nature of our quest. 

Let us say, we are to search number 10 from a range say 1 to 50. We can ask questions but the only answer we get is a "Yes" or a "No". One of the way is to ask fifty questions. Hey - is it 1 ? No ! ;  Is it 2 ? No ! .......  We shall get to the answer in ten question because the number is 10. What if we were searching for 49 ?  Asking 49 questions seems really dumb. Is there a way to shorten our search. We are not only searching, we want to search as quickly possible. Don't we ? There is a better way. We can get to answer in around five questions. How ? 

- Lets ask first question - Is it greater than 25 ? - No ! --> Means it is between 1 and 24.
- There is no point asking if it is less than 25 because we already know that. So our next question is - Is it greater than 12 ? - No ! --> Means it is between 1 and 12. 
- Next question - same drill - Is it greater than 6 ? Yes ! --> Bingo ! We got a smaller range. The number is between 7 and 11. 
- Is it greater than 9 ? Yes! --> Means number is either 10 or 11.
- Is it greater than 10 ? - No ! --> Means the number is 10. 

So we got to the answer in five questions. Did you notice anything special in this approach ? We divide the population in roughly two halves and search one half. If we know the object of search is not there , we move on to next half. Either ways we  again split the population (search area) and repeat the operation. Does it look like a familiar pattern ? May be a Sine wave ? A sine wave that is reducing in wavelength and thus increasing in frequency ?No matter how big our search space (1 to a billion instead of 1 to 50) , the wave shortens in wave length pretty quickly and gets to almost a straight line. After that we can continue to cycle through the haves as long as we want. Infinitely. Is it 10 ? The answer always remains "Yes". We can of course close the probing when the game ends. But Answer 10 for this specific session of the game is written down in the history of games between me and you :-). This is knowledge. The answers "Yes" and "No" - the wave - is information. 

The first thing to note here is turning information into knowledge is an iterative process. And knowledge is a sum of the question (context) and the answer. It takes many but finite number of cycles to get to the context and then unlimited cycles to keep the knowledge fresh.

The key thing in this splitting algorithm is, we must be open to searching outside our search space. We can split the space only if we agree to search the second half after first. This also means, we keep expanding our search time till we find what we are looking for. In the process our search space becomes smaller and smaller till it becomes almost a straight line. 

Other thing we notice that we never search the half that we already searched. There is no point going back there because we want to search as quickly as possible. Does it feel like our search is unidirectional ? Just like the "time" ! It is always pointed towards future. As a matter of fact we had the answer in the very first question. That the answer of our quest was in second half (between 1 to 25). In fact we had the answer even  before the quest - the number was between 1 and 50. But we keep on refining the quest till knowledge becomes exact. Or it gets packed in the least volume of possibilities. In a way, we are querying the future to get to a singular truth hidden in the reality.

> Math Alert - The idea that we can shorten the search to say five-ish questions (if our range is fifty) is based on a mathematical model. Fifty lies between the 2^5 and 2^6. Or alternatively we can say that that we should find the answer in log 2 (50) attempts . Which is around 5.6. This is the basis of a subject called "Information Theory" that was postulated by Claud E Shannon in the forties. Question - Why log of 2? Probably because our answer is either "Yes" or a "No" - a binary bit ! A tiniest amount of knowledge. 

In other words it doesn't matter how big is our search space. The only knowledge we have is if the object of our desire exist there or not . The knowledge is only a "Yes" or a "No". The question is a dimension. You may say we only have three dimensions. And that is true. The manifested reality around us appears three dimensional or four dimensional if you grace "Time" a separate dimension, but string theory shows us we need many more to get to this 3D experience. And that is simple physical stuff. If we try to decipher the philosophical questions such as "who am I?" we probably need thousands of them.

## Waves - the basis of our sensory apparatus.

We noticed from above discussion that our quest is a sine wave. The question is how do we search ? What is the apparatus ? We have three primary sensors when it comes to search - Ears , Eyes and Touch. We perceive the world through these senses. Perceiving is, in a way, probing the reality with questions. And understanding what the reality is telling us. We are very good at getting the answers to what we regularly probe. For example when you look at your chair - you don't ask - Are you a table ? Or are you stool?. We instantly know that it is a table. But for the things that we have never seen before - we ask the questions. Are you a planet ? - No , Are you are star?  - No, Are you a Black hole ? - Yes. Viola! Once we recognize it is a Black Hole , Our quest wave gets shortened in wavelength and high in frequency. Just like they do when we look at a "Chair". 

Another key question is what is it that we search in ? We probe the reality for what we looking for but what exactly is the nature of reality itself in which we are probing ? The answer to these two fundamental questions become bit less hazy as we understand the waves around us because reality is not very different from our quest. 

Let is look at different type of waves and the sensors we have for such waves. By the end of this discussion on waves, I hope, we shall conclude that every thing around us is a sine wave. A signal that we may choose to decipher if we want to ..

### Mechanical waves  - Ears.

These are the waves that move through the mediums such as solids, air and liquids by vibrating the matter molecules . In essence, these are the waves of "manifested" objects. When the molecules vibrate perpendicular to the apparent motion of waves they are called transverse waves - e.g. the waves that we see in a pond. When they jiggle in the same direction as the motion of the wave they are called "longitudinal" waves. Sound waves are the example of the "longitudinal" waves. Our ears are the sensors for the sound waves. Since these waves travel through solids , we can hear someone talking across the wall. We can even hear equally well under water if the source of sound is under water but if we mix the mediums - e.g source of sound in air while our ears are under water or vice versa - the waves get messed up. A better understanding of mechanical sound waves led to the discovery of Sonar that helps hear the sounds of under water sub-marines. The bottom line is these waves pass information in the manifested mediums such as solids , liquids and the air. They can't travel through the space. We shall discover the "space" when we discuss EM waves.

The key point however is we are trying to hear what the reality is telling us. Is it a roar of a lion or a roar of the clouds ? Deeper study of the nature of sound waves can help us make better sensors such as Sonars but the goal is to better decipher the reality around us for what we are looking for. In a way , all the tools that we invent is an extension of our sensory apparatus. They help us collect more and more information but the knowledge held in such extension is still a "Yes" or a "No". Let us say you are looking for an ice cream on a hot summer day. You see a coffee shop. You can understand there is coffee there but what you really know is that there is "No" ice cream there. Each of such extraneous sources of information are what we shall refer to as "Noise from extra dimensions of our quest". Too much of such noise can drown down the signal of our Quest. Finding an ice cream shop in a mall is lot harder than finding one on the road :-)

## Electromagnetic waves - Eyes.

Electromagnetic waves , such as visible light or the radio waves, engulf everything around us .  Our eyes are a sensor that can receive the information trough the visible part of EM spectrum , just like a radio antenna may interpret the signal from the radio waves. We know that EM waves have a broad spectrum starting from radio waves on one side with longest wavelength to the gamma rays on the other side with the shortest wavelength. Gamma rays may get so much energetic that they may feel like matter - just like bullets being fired from an air gun.

Visible light is reflected by the solids. So the waves of visible light, can be used to see the solids. That is exactly what eyes are for :-) And God , they see colorful things because visible light has a full rainbow with in it. Such is the beauty of our tiny box. But the real purpose of EM waves is to define our spatial boundaries. Our universe is filled up with Electro-magnetic field. There is no manifestation beyond this space. This is the entire space around us where light may reach. In essence this is the reality of our existence and ultimate frontier for our probing.

So we can hear someone across the wall - thanks to mechanical waves. But we can't see across the wall. There are lot more things going on with electromagnetic waves as to how they get absorbed into solids and how they reflect. These nuances led to the Nobel prize for Albert Einstein in 1921 where he showed the photoelectric effect. He proved that the electromagnetic waves have a particle nature. They are made of photons. Photons at a specific frequency can knock off an electron from a metal plate. Hence the birth of the idea of wave-particle nature (of waves). And of course, depending on the frequencies, EM waves can penetrate through certain solids. This idea led to the discovery of X rays. But the key things to remember here are the basics -  Maxwell's description of EM waves. 

<p align="center">

  <img src="./emf.gif">

</p>  

 The electric and magnetic fields (what we refer to as electromagnetic field) are always at a perpendicular to each other and they fill these two dimensions across our entire space. Which means that EM waves are basically two dimensional waves. In other words what we see is the outcome of information flowing to us from two dimensions. Or even more accurate way of saying this is - what we see with our eyes is an outcome of what we are searching in two dimensions at a given point in time. This two dimensional view can only give us a 2d view of reality - like the experience in a cinema hall but we can't really touch of feel such perception.

> Science Alert :-  In a way, electro magnetic field is a two dimensional section of our 3D reality.  What exists in that section is a Photon. The appearance of this 2d massless object is a circular rotation because if you merge two sine waves of same frequency and amplitude what you see on an oscilloscope is a circle. In essence a circular rotating manifestation of a photon is an outcome of information flowing to us from two dimensions. The energy of this photon increases or decreases based on the oscillations of the field. Shorter wave lengths (higher frequency) make them bullet like photons of gamma rays. Bigger wavelengths make them low energy photons of radio waves. This field goes till our observable universe because the light from those far flung places reaches us (that is how we can observe them). Beyond that is the universe beyond our sensory apparatus. From sensory apparatus I means all the tools and machines of science that help our senses collect information. The larger part of our universe is unobservable unless we device a worm hole or learn to travel more than the speed of light ..which of course Mr. Einstein won't approve !


A better understanding of EM waves can help up build better tools to collect more information. For example we built Radios, TVs and Phones as we better understood the EM waves but again, the point is more information doesn't guarantee you what you are looking for because information exists in "unobservable" universe too - beyond our sensory reach. In fact it may create more noise and distractions. The knowledge held in such distractions is pretty useless if not downright counterproductive.

### Gravitational waves

The next obvious question is what creates the space itself that is inundated with EM waves. Einstein predicted existence of something called Gravitational waves in general relativity. You see whenever it is a question of waves, Einstein is always around :-). If you want a crude physical analogy than imagine a pond. There are always some waves in a pond even if there is no wind. That is something like EM waves. But is there a wave that is expanding the "pond" itself ? You can say that the regular waves do help expand the pond. They do, but we are talking massive increase in the size of the pond. Like a swimming pool in our backyard to something that spans across entire Earth. Such expansion can't be cuz of regular waves. Such waves are thought to be the primary cause of exponential expansion of our universe in a split second after the big bang - the birth of our universe. In essence, these waves created the space itself. 

The sad part is, we cant perceive these waves in our daily life with our regular senses. Scientists have won many Nobel prizes in figuring out how to detect Gravitational waves and actually detecting them. Though the idea is rooted back in 1890s, it is still at the bleeding edge of science. Why ? Because if we better understand the gravitational waves, we may be able to build devices to use space as a signal. Yup - we are talking about the worm holes and wrap drives and time travel :-) But for now, all that is still a Hollywood fantasy though the mathematics and science is quite strong. I mean they don't give Nobel prizes for random pieces of imagination. 

That said, I must add , it is once again more information. It doesn't change the fact that our Quest is intrinsic to who we are rather than how big or small is our universe. A universe of the size that we live in, I guess, is quite big for us to find what we are looking for ! However, gravitational waves do give us a beautiful insight. That is when solid objects of massive size and scale (think black holes or super novae) dance around each other, they send out massive energy that can't just be consumed in the existing space. Thus the space itself must expand. This energy can be so intense that it may kick a Black hole (a singularity) out of its place and start the initial wiggle. Which means Gravitational waves from some other universe could be the cause of wiggling of the singularity that led to creation of our universe. No wonder its a thought insane enough even from a science fiction standpoint but a real scientist said that gravitational waves are the waves of our "Thought"

### Matter waves - Touch.

We can see the solids with our eyes but how do we confirm the existence of solids. How do we know that the solids that we are seeing are not a video projection on some grand large screen. Turns out we are gifted with another sensor that can help us distinguish the solids from thin air - literally. And that sensor is spread all over our body - it is called the sense of Touch. 

So how do we feel the solids ? What exactly is sense of Touch ? For this we need little bit of history of our science..

> Science History - Fun Stuff 
>
> Back in the day, Einstein had proved that the light actually behaves like a particle. And that gave rise to the idea that has mesmerized the scientists as well as philosophers - what we call wave -particle nature of waves. But the idea of Einstein that a wave may behave like a particle, led De Brogli (Pronounced Broy) to think the opposite. If wave can act like a particle, is it possible that all the matter - the solids that we touch and feel may also act like waves. He submitted his PhD thesis n 1923 that was summarily rejected by his PI as stupid mental math. To his good luck, somehow his paper made it to Einstein. You see Einstein is everywhere - like God! Einstein saw his paper and not only agreed to the math but he gave him a Thumbs Up. BTW this was the first time that a PhD thesis won the Nobel prize. Now that is called a real brilliant science. It took the  world six long years to digest what De Brogli proved so his prize came in 1929 . I guess it was totally worth the wait because the idea laid the foundation of Quantum Mechanics. What De Brogli showed us is known as "Matter waves". He showed that the tiny electrons are actually a manifestation of waves. And these waves are very different from the Electromagnetic waves. So between Einstein and De Brogli - It got proved that everything is dualistic - waves have particle nature when they manifest and particles have a wave nature when they turn into information. And almost 100 hears later , I am still scratching my bald head !

You might feel that electrons are moving in a wave - like up and down of Mechanical waves. Nope - that is NOT a matter wave. Well, it is easy to say what is "NOT" a matter wave but it is difficult to comprehend  a matter wave. The easiest analogy is when matter waves come together such that their amplitude peaks up like a tsunami - that is where the particle shows up. In other words, particle can be anywhere in the entire universe but it shows up only where the matter waves come together to peak up the crest. These waves are also called probability waves and are put into equation as Schrodinger's wave function. And obviously, if matter waves are opposing such that they cancel each other than we feel nothing there. And here is the worst part, these matter waves are so small that we have no instrument to measure them (unless particle is tiny like an electron or a sodium atom) . 

> Deep Science - Cautiously funny. 
>
> Since the waves are so small, we feel the solids as persistent pieces of matter. Why ? Because we need infinitely many waves to come together at the same point in "Time". This means a three dimensional interference pattern is almost unique in a very large universe. Or in other words - the perceptible bands of this 3D spectrum are universe apart, may be in other dimensions.  That is the reason the  baseball that you are holding in your hand is blinking in and out of existence. It is vanishing and showing up but it does it so fast that we feel it is always there in our hands and never there anywhere else in our universe.

> What if the pattern shows up somewhere and we see two tsunami peaks?

> At our scale, it happens in Hollywood but technically,  that is possible and has been observed at sub atomic scales. Physics has a very romantic name for such particles - they are called "Entangled" ! 
>
> We may  mistake such particles as two different particles. They are actually the same particle manifested at two places in space. We will define space-time down the line in this post, when we get to more intriguing stuff - "Time".

This persistence is further confirmed by multi sensory experience. Even electromagnetic waves - such as visible light, can't pass trough these infinitely small waves.  And that is why we not only feel the baseball but we also consistently see it in our hand. Not only that , our hearing also confirms the solids manifestation . As we know the mechanical waves travel through matter. If we pluck (or tap) a manifested matter shape, it produces sound waves . Just like sound waves that are produced deep in the guts of matter, EM waves are also produced by matter but from it's surface. Science has a funny name for this too - they call it "Black Body Radiation'! If you see closely , Science and Hollywood are pretty close when it comes to naming the things :-)  

Thus we focus all of our three wave senses on the matter. In other words matter waves manifest a solid that we can touch, EM waves reflect from solids so that we may see them at a location in space and our hearing confirms the distance at human scales unless you are flying a supersonic jet. This is the real solid manifestation of reality around us. Now you may start thinking that this reality is illusion. That would be a mistake because this solid reality is a reflection of our quest. In essence, it is who we are.

Thus waves are the basis of our sensory experience. This also means our senses as well as manifestation is real or external. It is not something that is happening in our minds alone. 

There is one more problem. And that is we need more than three dimensions to explain matter waves mathematically. That is where the crazy mathematics of "string theory" fits in but that is obviously beyond the scope of this chapter. If you must, I highly encourage you to search "Quantum Gravity"  ten times on Google. After that Youtube algorithm will automatically make you a quantum scientist :-) Caution - your world as you see it today may fall apart and that would be absolutely against `Karm Yoga`. 


> The point that I want to make at this stage is - EVERYTHING IS A WAVE. We see, feel and hear ONLY waves. In nutshell our sensory reality is nothing but an infinite ocean of waves - of different nature, of different wavelengths, amplitudes and thus frequencies. Now , you can say that even "waves" may be a figment of our imagination but I tend to believe there is a real manifested world out there and we have three major senses (sight , touch and hearing) to experience this world. In addition we have taste and smell to appreciate the chemical diffusions in our vicinity. Our sensory world is real more because if it was me alone imagining things to myself then it had be a very solo and sad world. Why would I choose to live here? And later we will see that we are what we want to be - what we believe in. You may already know it but I must prove it scientifically - to myself ! 
>
> For now , the question is if our perceived reality is REAL , where do "waves" fit in ? 

## Waves as carrier of Information

The strange thing about waves is we perceive our sensory reality through them, but we can't perceive the waves. In essence, our senses are decoders of the information carried through waves. For example, I can hear what you say through sound waves but I can't perceive the sound waves themselves till someone puts a mathematical model to explain those waves. In essence, the sound waves are information, what I perceive are the "words" that I hear.  Thus words are the manifestation of  sound waves decrypted correctly. However random words are pretty useless . They are noise unless they are understood in a context. The context and the meaning of the words is what "knowledge" is. Both are inseparable - the question - that doesn't change with time (except for the initial probing to get to the context), and the answer that is linked to a specific time stamp. Our mission is to keep this little piece of decrypted knowledge in smallest shape and keep it fresh because that is the best way to respond to changing conditions. "Fresh" and "real" knowledge is crucial to survival. That is the reason you don't want to take your eyes off the base ball till you actually hit it. But you don't want to engage in an eye contact with a lion roaming free in jungle. The knowledge tells you to immediately climb a tree.

Mathematical models to understand the nature of waves and the experiments done to test such models often lead to new applications of science. We discover new tools. For example when Maxwell combined waves in electric field and those in magnetic fields perpendicular to each other, it opened new paradigms in science. Einstein showed that the manifestation of these two waves is a "Photon" that may act as matter and De Brogli proved the reverse. We discovered a spectrum of electromagnetic waves that finally led to a revolution in communication technology. Radio and TV are the shining applications of electromagnetic waves. With them we can see the moving pictures on our TV screen but we don't perceive the electro magnetic field itself. For anyone coming from 18th century, the idea of telephone is almost magical. Yet, electromagnetic waves are beyond our senses. We can only decode the signals sent through EM waves but we can't perceive the fields themselves. In a way, the underlying infrastructure of information and its transfer into knowledge is hidden to us. Our sensory perception is tied to the manifestation of information. We can experience this manifestation to draw knowledge. 


 Same is true about the matter waves. One of the coolest application of matter waves is of course electron microscope. And along with electron microscope we saw a revolution in particle physics. In a way electron microscope proves that the matter waves exist. The entire field of quantum mechanics sprung up around matter waves. Neils Bohr demonstrated that the electrons appear only in quantum orbits around the nucleus. Heisenberg gave the uncertainty principle. And Schrodinger worked out the wave equations. So many Nobel prizes got distributed in the pursuit, yet we can't perceive the matter waves. We only perceive the information carried by the matter waves and that information is matter itself. And the mechanical waves produced in the matter. And the EM waves originating from the heated matter. Matter is something that we not only see with our eyes but also confirm through touch. It feels as if solids are asking us to observe them. They are giving a total sensory immersion. How and where do we start our journey to  understand the solids ? 

I may also add, just like what we may see or hear , perception of solids too have a noise to signal ratio. Just because we can see lot of matter around, doesn't mean we have unlocked the knowledge. All we have is more information in terms of if it is a chair or not. The key question again is we need to parse this noise from what is in reality and what we are looking for. The thing is too much ain't any good if it is not what we are looking for. That means the real question is what we are looking for ? I guess we might find the answer if we understand the "time" - the cycle of time to be more accurate.

---

## Time - expanse of information.

Time that we measure , is the beat of our universe at the tiniest level. In 1968 , time was set up as a standard for the beats of a Cesium atom. We have much better quantum clocks now but the idea remains the same. The question is what do we mean by the beat of an atom ? And is there a signal in this beat. I tend to believe "Yes" because if something is happening in every single atom in this entire universe, there must be a good reason. Just like any thing else, time may be explained in many ways - for example increase of chaos or how long is it since you ate that big burrito. Time is also deemed as a separate dimension -sometimes misconstrued as a spatial dimension. All those may be true in different contexts but I want to investigate "time" from the vantage of information processing and hopefully you will see by the end, how this notion explains most of the things we observe in our our tiny box and also hints at what is the path forward. I must add, understanding "Cycle of Time" - `KaalChakra` is kinda mandatory to recon as to where we stand in the glorious maze of manifestations & knowledge. The good (or bad !) news is we might pick few basic concepts of Physics along the way. Intent is not to make you a scientist but it gets easy if we go by the things that are well proven rather than a fancy flight of imagination. 

### Time is the information field

The easiest way to imagine time as an information field is to try visualize a one dimensional line . Assume a point is wiggling from time line "T-1" to "T+1". T being the center.  Time is unidirectional upwards which means future is pointing up and past is down. Plane Z indicates the time front - A frame representing "Now". You can say we have a horizontal one dimensional line and a timeline attached to every single point on that line as shown in T+1 and T-1. The job of the time line is to capture the history the  point .  

The information is represented as "Y" and "N" . "Y" being particle is visible. "N" being particle is invisible.


![](./1dif.jpg)

So that we don't conflict with planes that connect two dimensions; lets just call our plane as "one dimensional information field". 1dif - for short. The answer that each point of 1dif records is "yes" or "No" based on the question. Question can be - Is something there ? - Answer can be a "yes" or a "no". Or the question can be - is the temperature more than 20 degrees ? - Answer can be "yes" or "no". You got it!  Time stamp only records "yes" or "no". A "zero" or a "One". An "Up" or a "Down". A "plus" or a "minus". Those are all just notations. The question defines what does it mean when time stamp says "yes" verses a "No". In essence, the answer is written in the time line. What you are trying to figure out is a right question. 

You may ask why the point is wiggling ? Why is it not at rest ? That is a valid question. The answer is if the massless point is not wiggling , it has no information. Means it doesn't exist. In order to exist, everything must wield some information and everything that has information also has motion. Thus motion is "Truth". Absolute rest is not possible. But the information our massless particle has in this one dimension is not very useful. All it knows is that it exists. At a point in time. 

The wiggle in one dimension creates a sine wave in time. As shown in the graphic above. So our particle knows that it exists. It sure can estimate from the timeline that it is wiggling. 


### A two dimensional information field. - 2DIF

The easiest way to imagine a 2DIF is to imagine a  2 dimensional plane and then assume a third dimension of time at every single point of the plane. 

![](./2dif.jpg)

Both the dimensions are feeding into one timeline. 

For example let us say there is a dimension that is sending one unique number. Say that number is 10 but this number is hidden to us . Time line is only telling us "Yes " or "No" based on the value it sees in the signal. To figure out what the first dimension is telling us, we can design the second dimension such that it interferes with first dimension. 

One way is to send a signal for every possible value through second dimension and ask the question - Is there a crest of size double the signal you are sending in second dimension. But that is if you are lucky in the sense you only have a small population to check. The easier way is to send the same wave through second dimension that is coming in first dimension. And see the interference pattern. 

In a way interference pattern is the manifestation of the two dimensions. In essence we need second dimension to check what is there in the first. Now the question is simple - is it 20 ? And timeline can keep answering -"yes" or "no" . Just one beat that confirms the integrity of and value of first dimension. But in the process we introduced a "duality". Now there are two waves of the same shape - in two separate dimensions. This is a profound thing. Let us call this "convergence"

Once the convergence is achieved and quest is answered, the time line can stop. If quest goes to infinity , the time line can keep searching for the expected value . In essence , timeline shall also grow to the infinity. Convergence depends on the nature of the quest. Length of timeline depends on the duration of the quest. 

It is important to state that the notion of "a dimension" is something that is not influenced from any other dimension. It has nothing to do with the width or the thickness - those measures come into play when we start viewing the world in three dimensions. Since no information is allowed from outside , the idea of spinning a second dimension to know what is there in first, must come from with in the first dimension. This means - the idea of finding "who I am " is in built into the first dimension itself. 

All we know is there is an answer in time line. And all we want to know what is the right question. In other words - we are Focused on a single point and our quest is to frame the question. It will be easy if we give a name to this point - we can call it "focus". In `Hath Yoga` - this single point in one dimensional time line is called `Bindu` - which literally means a "point" in Sanskrit. 

The best example of 2DIF field is a electromagnetic field.  Let's look at a single time line of two dimensional electro-magnetic field. "X" is the dimension of electric field, "Y" is the dimension of magnetic field and "Z" is the Time pointing towards past.

For the sake of this discussion, assume electric and magnetic impulses are same but they are pointing in two dimensions perpendicular to each other. Z - the time line is shown at a point where these two dimensions intersect. . At every point on the time line, we receive two values from the signal. These values gradually increase from 0 to say 5 and then again reduce to 0. 

So the question in this case is " Is the value of x same as Y" - And the answer is "Yes" or "No".

The important insight in this question is value of "X" is somehow linked to value of "Y". Means they are interdependent. If the answer is "Yes" , that means an electro magnetic field exists. 

> #### Photon
>
>The manifestation of this field is what we call a Photon. To simplify the things , assume there is an "electron" sitting at the intersection of "X" and "Y". This electron moves in X dimension exactly the same distance as it does in the Y dimension. How is it possible that the same particle moves in two dimensions at the same time ? From our discussion of "entanglement" above , this means it is the same particle trying to manifest in two dimensions. It starts at the intersection of X and Y and moves in both directions as the time passes. After reaching certain (same) distance it falls back to original state. In essence two entangled manifestations of the same particle are wiggling in two dimensions. It must be same particle because by definition a dimension is a thing where information can't come from outside. Since the particle knows how much to move in both dimensions , that means it must be the same particle or "same entangled particle" to be linguistically correct. :w
>
>In essence the particle is creating a gap with in its own two entangled positions. This gap is filled up by what we know as "Photon". Since it is a gap , the Photon must be mass less.

It is easy to imagine that if there is more energy , the particle shall wiggle farther. And vice versa. If it goes farther, the resultant photon is UV or X ray photon. In case of extreme energy situation such as radio active decay, or Quasars , this photon can carry the energy of gamma rays. In case of small energy, we get a much shorter wiggle and thus a photon of radio waves. The key insight of Einstein was no matter the energy level , the frequency of wiggle stays constant and thus the speed of photon generation in Time. Turns out this speed of photons generation is what we know as the speed of Time. The key thing to understand here that in electro magnetic fields, it is not "Photon" that is moving , It is the speed of "Time". 

> #### Duality
>
> In essence , a 1DIF gives us the notion of Focus, while a 2DIF defines our time. You may ask why Time or Light move at this specific speed 299792458 metres per second ? We may get that answer when we understand the "matter waves" because ultimately photons are produced by the wiggle of electrons - which are three dimensional manifestations - at least to our perception. However , this addresses a deeper question that 2DIF EMF is deeper than what we thought. From deeper I mean a notion of duality is in built into Electro magnetic fields. It is a point where our focus wants to split into two dimensions at the same time. Both valid. 
>
>Duality is the hall mark of the waves. Every rise must follow a fall. Every crest has a trough and vice versa. Since the fundamental perception is of Time is built by a dualistic wave, everything we perceive in this universe shows a wave nature. In essence Duality is not limited to magnetic dipoles - or simply the magnets. Duality is built into nature of our sensory observations - our perception of the world. 



### Garbage Collection

Every point in the information field must have information - Yes or No ; 0 or 1  - binary information. Point with no information can't exist. As soon as a timeline goes empty, the dimension is quickly garbage collected. This is so because Time is the most taxing resource in the system. This is where all "Actions" are performed and thus energy is consumed. Since energy must be conserved, there is a need to optimize the time lines. 

One important distinction needs to be made here, Sometimes when "No" is represented by "0" , it appears as if "0" is nothing. That is not true. Nothing means absence of both 0 and 1 . Absence of signal . In a way time is history of one computing bit.

### Every point in the information field has a information space.
Information Fields of many spatial dimensions can co-exist in a single dimension of time. That means if you have two spatial dimensions , you don't need two more dimensions for time. In a multi-dimensional scenario , think a dimension as as a channel feeding some information to an intersection on timelines.Information can come in from any channel, history registers from any channel. More the dimensions, the information block gets bigger. 
### In a way , Time is universal memory.
### 1d information fields are infinite 
because there is no way to tell where to purge the memory, for that you need 2d time info field which by design becomes dualistic. And second because there is no way to tell how big a dimension can be.
### 2d information field photons- ie information itself. Information is thus infinite and dualistic. 
### Manifestation is finding what you are looking for at a point in time. -- Define Quest first. Linkage to wave nature of manifestation- manifestation happens at the place of highest probability with respect to your quest function - what are you looking for.
Define space as "no"land where no means "irrelevant" to the quest - what we are searching for. Quest is the entry of senses. Senses are there to search something. Whenever we are use Schrodinger's wave equation , we are always looking for an electron or some other particle. Wave function doesn't mean anything unless you are looking for something in a wave. The signal.

Entanglement can happen in many dimensions separately. Means things can be partially entangled. We scientifically call it "Entanglement" when we observe it in our 3d space i.e. manifested shape. 
### 3d information fields manifest solids. Solids lead to gravity and thus singularity. 
### Thus Kaal Chakra is the cycle from knowledge to manifestation and then manifestation to knowledge. 
Knowledge to Information is in a sense broadcast of information. It ends with manifestation by senses. Manifestation to singularity (gravity) is simplifying the manifestation such that it becomes singularity - matter turns into holographic information.
### Infinite dimensions are possible
3d is a minimum requirement for manifestation of solids. But there is no limit to more dimensions if they could be used for journey from manifestation to singularity. Better coding is another for example DNA. Intelligence is the iterative process to taking shots at that configuration. The configuration itself is the knowledge. Thus singularity is not a point. It is the expression of knowledge. And that is the very reason of quest. Though understanding what we are looking for is too an iterative process. 

It had be rather naive to imagine that this circle is around us. As if we are the drivers of knowledge to information  or from manifestation to knowledge because the cycle in itself is endless. But we do have a complete cycle around who we are. And since our copy of knowledge is same as anything else, our cycle is same as that of the entire universe. 

## Quest

Waves are signals. Time is history of points in dimensions. Space is the "no land". What we are searching here is our quest. We can choose to search in one dimension or many dimensions. As many as we want. With each quest there is a cost to paid in terms of how many dimensions. What questions to ask in each dimension. And checking the persistence of those answers. If we don't find what we are looking for our focus must move. Thus motion is mandatory for quest. Absolute rest is observing what we are seeing and understanding what question our perception is answering. The work done to support the motion is work for desires. Work done for understanding what question your tiny box is answering at this moment is `Karm Yoga` - responding to the reality around us. A

In essence holding our quest to our reality and acting to find the question that manifestation around is answering. Path to this state is first training our focus to one single goal without spinning multiple dimensions of desires. We can have many dimensions to understand our reality too. There is work involved here too. Once we understand what question our reality is telling us , we see who we are ! Our reality is US. Our reality is expression of decryption of our own knowledge. In built into us. 

## Waves to a circle to a dot.

A wave has two primary aspects - time , normally plotted on the x axis and an amplitude plotted perpendicular to the linear time. If we take the time aspect out of the wave, a wave is nothing but a spinning circle. The idea of removing the linear time from x axis is not uncommon. Such plots are called "circular graphs", sometimes also referred to as unit circle. The spin of the circle defines its wave-length  and the size of the circle defines it's amplitude. Together they represent "frequency". 

If we understand that "time" is a creation of our sensory perception, than it is obvious that underlying reality is circular in two spatial dimensions , a sphere in 3D space and something beyond us in four spatial dimensions and above. 


For reference and a better visualization, [check this out](https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/sincos.html).

Let us assume we are at the center of the circle and we want to observe the circumference in a clock or anticlockwise fashion. What we observe is a wave. This is because our senses focus only at one point at an instance. Thus our focus moves along the circumference. Since we must move forward in time, the circle appears as wave. We will discuss more about this idea down the line in this post. 

One may argue that even circle has some element of time in terms of it's diameter on the x axis. And that is correct. If we remove the diameter too, then we have a dimensionless point. In `Hathyoga` , this point is called `Bindu` - or "focus". Being dimensionless (and thus massless), this point has absolute freedom to move in any dimension. And, since the limitations  of speed (speed of light) arise only with respect to time, we can say such limitations are attached only to our physical reality - as such `Bindu` has no meaning of speed. For example, you can think of a black-hole at the center of our milky way right now. It might take billions of years to reach there in our physical reality.  

When this focus rotates around an expression of knowledge, it must move around the expression to fully encapsulate it. In a way, focus expands to capture a piece of knowledge. On a two dimensional paper, it appears as a loop. And , with addition of unidirectional time, it appears as a wave. We know waves with higher frequency appear as solids to our sensory apparatus - why ? We will discuss down the line. 

This cycle of encapsulation of knowledge into waves of manifestation is the first half of the continuum. The dimensionless point of focus may also be referred to as "Singularity" though our definition is slightly at odds with that of popular science. Will describe this also in more details in ensuing paragraphs. In a way the cycle of "knowledge to manifestation" is same as formation of universe from a singularity to what we have now - an expanding universe. But "singularity to manifestation" is NOT only about the Bing Bang. It is an equilibrium of infinite manifestations happening without any notion of time, with in our own universe and in many other universes. It is a continuum at equilibrium. Knowledge turns into manifestations and manifestations turns into knowledge -endlessly. In that seeking the initiation of our physical reality is meaningless because it is a unique point only in our perception. The birth of universe is quite similar to our own birth - the start of our sensory perception. 


To initiate this first half of a specific cycle, the `Bindu` must move to capture a piece (expression) of "knowledge".  Such motion of "focus" is not limited to three dimensions. It can be any number of dimensions. A two dimensional projection is easy to grasp for us because our sensory apparatus supports a three dimensional view of the manifestations. This is an important differentiation from science in that the manifestation is relative to our perception. In science, our (human) perception used to treated as absolute till Einstein showed that our perception of length, time and mass is not absolute . But we don't need to travel near speed of light to prove the limitations of senses. The study of wave spectrum showed that there are many waves that are beyond our visible spectrum. 

You may ask why this motion of `Bindu` must be circular. The answer is it may NOT. From circular I mean "iterative". That is because to get to the geometric shape of a chunk (expression) of knowledge, focus must iterate multiple paths through multiple dimensions , till it finds a path that fully encapsulates the knowledge i.e it makes a closed loop. This closed loop on a two dimensional surface may appear as a circular vibrating loop; in a four dimensional space-time it will appear as closed strings. If you don't like "geometric" metaphors, it is simply an iterative model of learning. We know, iterations is the only way to perfect our knowledge. To understand something, our focus moves in many dimensions that are hard to describe in four dimensional space-time till we manifest our knowledge into something perceptible. In essence, the iterative nature of decryption of knowledge lends it a circular nature. From quantum mechanics standpoint, we may think this motion of focus as the probability wave. In essence, there is a small chance that `Bindu` may close the loop after circling around entire universe- as much as it may close the loop by circling around itself. All those possibilities appear as vibrations of the most probable loop. Most probable loop is what manifests in the shape of waves when consumed by our sensory apparatus.



Even after the loop is closed, there is tendency to shrink the loop because knowledge can be expressed in yet smaller loop. In a way, it is a continuous process if the information could be packed more densely while is still has a manifestable shape. This nature to represent knowledge in lesser and lesser (multi-dimensional) space is what we know as Gravity. As the loop becomes smaller - first we perceive it as higher frequency waves - e.g. solids. Thus the notion of mass. Further iterations of focus, can lead to a "Black hole" where the focus separates again into a singularity and knowledge spread all over its surface. In a way, `Bindu` always seeks ultimate freedom - true to its nature. Any closed loop holds the `Bindu` in a specific shape - but only so long. At some point the focus figures out better ways to arrange the knowledge such that enormous knowledge seems to be packed into it till it separates away into freedom leaving the knowledge spread all over the surface. 


You may ask, how does `Bindu` gets energy to move around a chunk of knowledge. The answer is it doesn't need energy because it is massless and dimensionless. In our world, it is something similar to our thoughts - you don't need to gas up your car if you just want to go someplace in your thoughts. Agreed, we need to have a brain to be able to think something and brain is the biggest consumer of energy in our body. But that energy is used by the brain to run the body. The physical manifestation. Let us say you are walking. Suddenly you have a thought of your parents living next door. You are still walking. The thought in itself doesn't consume any extra energy. If you imagine your parents being in Australia rather than being next door, it is not that you are going to consume extra energy. The actual meaning of energy is how much effort it takes to decrypt the knowledge that is locked in a loop.

Once `Bindu` closes a loop around an expression of knowledge, it tries to compact it as much as possible. It tries to reduce the size of the loop. As we know from string theory, these closed loops have elasticity. Smaller the circle, smaller are the information waves in terms of amplitude. And faster the angular momentum, more the frequency. Such waves are what we know as solids. As shown by De Brogli, the waves of solids are so dense that waves of bigger amplitude (or less frequency ) such as visible light can't pass through them. We call such loops as manifested. Why ? we will see when we discuss our sensory apparatus. 

The idea of solids (or miniaturization) of loops is not about solids alone. And idea that is well understood reduces to a single statement. For example, Einstein life log focus can now be described in a tiny equation - E=mc^2 . Such things become the physical laws till someone gets a even simpler description. Other property of manifested solids is it is easy to perceive them but the knowledge held with in them is harder to crack. It will need more and more effort to understand the nature of knowledge with held in them. This effort is equivalent to the "mass" we perceive in them. And again, it is NOT limited to solids, Einstein's simple idea also has enormous mass because it takes enormous energy to truly understand the meaning of mass energy equivalence.

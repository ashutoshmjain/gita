# Akshara Brahma Yoga: Unveiling Cosmic Reality Through the Lens of the Divine Play

The *Bhagavad Gita*, a revered jewel within the epic *Mahabharata*, stands as a timeless guide to human existence, offering profound insights into the nature of reality, the Self, duty, and the path to ultimate liberation. Among its eighteen chapters, the eighth, titled "*Akshara Brahma Yoga*" or "The Yoga of the Imperishable Brahman," holds a particularly crucial position. It unfolds as a direct response to deeply existential questions posed by the warrior prince Arjuna, who, on the battlefield of *Kurukshetra*, is overwhelmed by despondency and confusion about his duty and the ultimate meaning of life and death. This chapter delves into the foundational principles of the cosmos, the essence of being, the mechanics of action, and the means by which one can attain the Supreme. To navigate these profound metaphysical concepts, this essay employs a contemporary analogy—that of an intricate and immersive computer game—rendering these ancient teachings remarkably accessible to the modern mind. We will explore the seven fundamental questions Arjuna raises and Krishna’s illuminating answers, using this game analogy to unravel the path to understanding the Self, the Ultimate Reality, and the true nature of liberation from the cyclic 'game' of existence.

## The Cosmic Blueprint: Understanding Brahman, Swabhava, and Karma

Arjuna's inquiry begins with a desire to understand the very fabric of reality and his place within it. These are not abstract philosophical curiosities but urgent questions born from a profound crisis, demanding an understanding of the ultimate truths that govern life and action.

### Arjuna's Quest for the Absolute: What is Brahman?

Arjuna's first question, "What is *Brahman*?", seeks to comprehend the ultimate, foundational reality. In the *Vedantic* tradition, *Brahman* is often described as the Absolute—the ultimate ground of all existence, the unchanging, infinite, and transcendent principle. The interpretive framework of this essay, aligning with certain readings of Krishna's teachings in this chapter, defines *Brahman* succinctly as "the imperishable reality." This imperishability is key: *Brahman* is eternal, beyond the cycles of birth, death, and decay that characterize the manifest world.

To bring this abstract concept into a more relatable framework using our analogy:

* ***Brahman* as the Imperishable 'Game Code':** *Brahman* is akin to 'the code of the game... May be written in cloud or on a CD,' as one might phrase it within the analogy. It is the fundamental source code, the core algorithms, the game engine itself. This code is the immutable blueprint, the unchanging set of rules and principles that define the potential for any game universe, its physics, possibilities, and limitations. It doesn't alter with individual gameplay sessions. Just as the core code of a game like Chess or Go remains constant, *Brahman* represents the eternal, unmanifest potentiality and the immutable laws that underpin existence. It is the silent, unseen foundation upon which all phenomena are structured.

The actual manifestation of a 'single play of game'—the dynamic, ever-changing phenomenal world, with its myriad forms, characters, events, and "thousands of births" or respawns—is what we experience as material nature. As we will see when discussing *Adhibhuta*, this realm of 'artifacts within a single run of the game,' including 'skins, boosts, artifacts,' is the perishable, tangible world. It operates according to the rules established by the imperishable *Brahman* (the game code), but it is not *Brahman* itself. (It's worth noting that the dynamic qualities and constituents of this material nature are further elaborated in Chapter 7 of the Gita through the concept of the three Gunas, a point we will revisit in reconciling different descriptive frameworks.)

The analogy also helps interpret a point about the 'obsolescence' of 'games,' linked in some interpretations to the 'Night of Brahma.' This concept requires careful handling. While a specific game's *manifestation* (a particular universe or cosmic cycle) might become 'obsolete' or be withdrawn during the 'Night of Brahma' (a period of cosmic dissolution, or *Pralaya*), the *Brahman* as the fundamental 'source code' or the ultimate potential for a new 'Day of Brahma' (a new manifestation, *Srishti*) remains. Imperishable *Brahman* is the principle that *allows* for these grand cosmic cycles—akin to an ultimate server that can host, archive, and relaunch cosmic games, rather than being a piece of software that becomes entirely defunct. When a universe is actively manifested and 'played,' it is like the 'Day of Brahma'; when it is withdrawn or dormant, it's the 'Night of Brahma.'

### The Player's Essence: What is Adhyatma (Swabhava)?

Arjuna then probes his own nature: "Who am I? What is my role? And how may I act? In other words, what is my *Yajna*?" This question seeks to understand *Adhyatma*, often translated as the individual Self, the indwelling spirit, or one's essential nature. Krishna’s explanation, through the game analogy, is direct: "You are the role you are playing in the game. Your nature, called *Swabhava* in Sanskrit, is your role."

*Swabhava* is a critical concept representing one's innate disposition, inherent qualities, and natural tendencies that define one's character and influence actions. In the game analogy, this is akin to choosing a character class (e.g., warrior, mage, healer) or a specific character with a predefined set of skills, strengths, and weaknesses. This *Swabhava* is not an arbitrary assignment but reflects a deeper, intrinsic aspect of the individual soul's journey within the larger cosmic game. Understanding one's *Swabhava* is crucial because it informs how one should act—addressing the "how may I act?" part of Arjuna's question—in a way that is authentic and aligned with universal *dharma* (cosmic order). Actions performed according to one's *Swabhava*, especially when done selflessly, become *Yajna*: a sacred offering.

### The Mechanics of Action: What is Karma?

The third query, "What is *Karma*?", addresses the principle of action. While an initial definition suggested by the framing questions of the analogy implies it means "actions performed without desire," Krishna’s subsequent explanation, aligning more broadly with the Gita's teachings, clarifies *Karma* comprehensively. He states, according to this analogical interpretation, that *Karma* is "The actions you take in this game based on your *Swabhava* (your role)."

Crucially, Krishna distinguishes the consequences based on the motivation behind these actions:

* **Actions with Desire (Leading to Bondage):** "If these actions are performed under the influence of desires, they lead to karmic bondage. Thus you stay within the game." In the game, this equates to chasing points, achievements, or material gains purely for self-gratification. Such actions, driven by attachment to their fruits, bind the player more deeply to the game's cycle of rewards, punishments, respawns, and continued play.
* **Actions without Desire (*Yajna*):** "If actions are performed without desires, then obviously there is no bondage. Such actions are called *Yajna*." These are actions performed in accordance with one's *Swabhava*, as a duty, without craving personal gain. "*Yajna* is prerequisite for attaining union, i.e., Yoga with Krishna." This is the path of *Karma Yoga*, where action itself becomes a spiritual discipline and a means to liberation from the game.

Thus, *Karma* is the mechanism of action within the game, and *Yajna* represents the skillful, desireless way of playing that, instead of entangling the player further, purifies them and prepares them for an exit. In broader sense, Yazna is prerequisite for renunciation. Forcing renunciation onto self without first conquering the desires, as described in chapter 3 makes one pretender.

Giving up desires is also called `Visarga`. Lord says the Visarga is true Karma and universe is created because of his own `Visarga`. In other words manifestation happens only when we give up desires. Lords creation `Visarga` is thus reflected in our `Karma`. For an ordinary vantage, Yajna is thus seen as the ultimate sacrifice. 

## The Structure of the Cosmos and Experience: Adhibhuta, Adhidaiva, and Adhiyajna

Having laid the groundwork by defining *Brahman* (the fundamental 'game code'), *Adhyatma* (the player's role/Self), and *Karma* (the game's action-consequence mechanic), Arjuna's next questions delve into the governing principles and dominion within this cosmic structure. The term *Adhi* in Sanskrit, signifies "owner" or, more broadly, the presiding principle or ultimate authority over a particular domain.

### The Tangible World: Who is Adhibhuta?

"Who is *Adhibhuta*?" Arjuna asks, referring to the perishable, elemental, and physical realm—the material nature. The initial query within the analogical framework explores who "owns all the beings in physical reality." Krishna’s answer, via the game analogy, indicates that while in a specific game, "you, in your role, are the owner of the artifacts," ultimately, "all those artifacts go back into material nature."

*Adhibhuta* thus refers to this transient, material world itself—the entire domain of perishable entities and forms that are subject to change, decay, and dissolution. This is the "single play of game" or the "current instance of the game world" we discussed earlier, operating according to the principles laid down by *Brahman* (the game code). In the analogy, *Adhibhuta* encompasses all "perishable material artifacts—think of them as the rewards you win within a single run of the game: skins, boosts, artifacts, everything within one run of the game. Material nature." While the player (in their role) might temporarily possess or control these in-game assets, such ownership is fleeting. These elements ultimately belong to the game world—the material nature under the purview of *Adhibhuta*—and are reabsorbed or reset when a particular playthrough ends or transforms. *Adhibhuta*, therefore, is the entire perishable phenomenal world with which we interact through our senses. In more technical terms, the *Adhibhuta* may be referred to as the run-time of the game.

### The Governing Forces: Who is Adhidaiva?

Next, Arjuna inquires, "Who is *Adhidaiva*?" This question pertains to *Daiva*, meaning fate or destiny, and seeks to identify its presiding principle. *Adhidaiva* refers to the subtle divine forces, the cosmic intelligences, or the fundamental principle governing destiny and the universe's workings. In the game analogy, Krishna explains that "The code of the game, the logic that runs the game, ultimately decides the destiny within each run of the game. Thus, imperishable *Brahman* holds the destiny."

This establishes a powerful linkage: *Adhidaiva* is not a whimsical external agent but is integrally connected to the fundamental nature of *Brahman*—the imperishable 'game code.' The rules, probabilities, and intricate cause-and-effect chains programmed into this core logic dictate the unfolding of events and the range of possible outcomes for any player within the game. Just as a game's engine determines how scenarios play out based on player actions and preset parameters, *Adhidaiva* represents this cosmic operating system, the divine intelligence embedded within the fabric of creation itself, ensuring the universe operates according to inherent laws.

### The Ultimate Beneficiary of Actions: Who is Adhiyajna? And what constitutes Yajna?

Arjuna’s sixth question, "Who is *Adhiyajna*?", concerns the Lord or presiding principle of sacrifice (*Yajna*). As established, *Yajna* refers to "actions that we perform without the influence of desires. Such actions, in the context of *Karma Yoga*, are the ultimate sacrifices. These actions lead to true renunciation and thus ultimate liberation from karmic bondage."

Krishna’s response regarding *Adhiyajna* is profound and central to the Gita's message of devotion: "I am *Adhiyajna*—the creator of the game. I own all the sacrifices (*Yajnas*) you perform in the game." Here, the analogy beautifully converges with devotional philosophy. Krishna, as the Supreme Being, is the ultimate source, sustainer, and recipient of all selfless actions. He is the divine 'Game Creator,' the architect of the cosmic play.

When a player acts according to their inherent role (*Swabhava*) and performs their duties (actions) selflessly as *Yajna* (without attachment to outcomes), they are, in essence, playing their part in perfect harmony with the Creator’s design. Krishna elaborates, "If you act exactly as per your role (*Swabhava*) and perform your duty (actions) without desires (i.e., as *Yajna*), then you are acting exactly like Me, albeit inside the game." Such actions, offered to the Divine, do not create further bondage but instead purify the individual and align them with the Supreme. *Adhiyajna* is thus the Lord Himself, residing within all beings as the inner witness and ultimate recipient of all sacred, selfless deeds.

## The Path to Liberation: Exiting the Game

Understanding the structure of the game and its rules is vital, but Arjuna’s ultimate concern, like that of any spiritual seeker, is about transcendence—how to win or, perhaps more accurately, how to gracefully exit the game and attain a state beyond its inherent limitations and cycles.

### Arjuna's Pivotal Question: Attaining the Divine at the Point of "Game Over" (Death)

Arjuna then asks, "How do I attain You when the game is finished—that is, at the point of death in the game?" This question is the practical culmination of all preceding philosophical inquiries. What happens at the moment of death, the end of the current 'playthrough'? How can one ensure this transition leads to the ultimate goal: union with the Divine? It is crucial to remember that within the Gita's cosmology, 'game over' for one life often implies a 'respawn' into the cycle of *samsara*; the true "winning" or "exiting the game" is *Moksha*, liberation from this cycle altogether.

### Krishna's Guidance on Attainment

Krishna’s answer underscores the profound impact of one’s state of consciousness, particularly at the moment of death: players attain whatever state of being they recall at that time. This principle highlights the importance of a lifetime of practice and focused awareness.

* **Focusing on Material Aspects:** If individuals "connect with material things, they keep on playing the game and chase material things." If one's mind is predominantly absorbed in 'in-game items'—worldly possessions, attachments, unresolved desires—then that mental state dictates the trajectory for the next 'respawn' or rebirth. The player remains caught in the loop, driven by familiar patterns of seeking and attachment.
* **Focusing on *Brahman* (the 'Game Code'):** If they "focus on *Brahman*," they "connect with the runtime of the game." Contemplating *Brahman*—the imperishable 'game code' or underlying reality leads to a higher state, perhaps a more cosmic consciousness or a subtler level of existence. This is a significant attainment, a connection with the foundational fabric of the 'game,' but it might not necessarily be the ultimate, personal union with the 'Game Creator' Himself. Krishna says, such higher births, after exhausting their privileges again get into the same cycle.
* **Devotion to Krishna (the 'Creator'):** The most direct path to ultimate liberation is through unwavering devotion: "But if they have full devotion to Me—always connected to Me while performing *Yajna*—they meet Me." This involves constant remembrance of Krishna (the Supreme Being, the 'Game Creator') throughout life, performing all actions (*Yajna*) as an offering to Him, and cultivating an intimate, loving relationship. A devotee whose consciousness is steeped in the Divine naturally remembers Him at the time of departure and thus attains Him.

### The Liberated Player: Becoming a Yogi

Those who achieve this state of union "get over playing the game. They become creators or builders of the game and attain everlasting peace, freedom from bondage—*Nirvana*. Such people are called Yogis." This is a powerful and inspiring image. The liberated soul, the Yogi, is no longer merely a character within the 'game,' subject to its rules and illusions. They transcend the player-perspective, gaining insight into the very mechanics and purpose of creation. To "become creators or builders" can be understood as attaining a divine nature, participating in the cosmic harmony (lila) from a place of enlightened freedom, and understanding the 'rules' so profoundly they are no longer bound by them, existing in perfect alignment with the divine will. This is the attainment of *Nirvana*—the cessation of suffering, freedom from the cycle of birth and death (*samsara*), and the realization of everlasting peace and bliss. Such a Yogi, Krishna emphasizes, is "better than all other forms of devotions and actions," indicating that this integrated path of loving devotion and selfless action is supreme. Contrary to conventional wisdom, only Yogies can manifest artifacts of lasting nature. Not only they connect with Krishna, but with in limits of their `Swabhava` they imbibe Krishna's creative forces. Don't imagine them as saints sitting in caves of Himalayas, Yogies are actively building the beautiful things. The world shines because of their `Visarga`.

## Akshara Brahma Yoga: The Synthesis of the Imperishable and Creation

The chapter, and this entire line of inquiry, culminates in a synthesis that gives the chapter its name: *Akshara Brahma Yoga*. The concluding summary points, as interpreted through the essay's analogical framework, are:

* "Lord Krishna is the creator—divine."
* "*Brahman* is the imperishable reality (the 'CD analogy' or 'game code'), and the material nature (the 'single run' or manifested game) operates based upon this code."
* "You are playing a role in the game."

This framework elegantly ties together the core components of the analogy: "From your standpoint, I (Krishna) am *Akshar* (imperishable divine), and *Brahman* (as the foundational principle) is the basis of creation," thus, this chapter is called *Akshara Brahma Yoga*" 

*Akshar* means the immutable, the indestructible. This refers to the Supreme Spirit, God, who is eternal and unchanging—Krishna Himself. *Brahman*, in this context of synthesis, refers to the ultimate, imperishable reality that serves as the foundational principle or 'source code' for all existence. While the created cosmos (the domain of *Adhibhuta*) is the manifest, perishable 'game run,' it derives its structure and laws from the imperishable *Brahman*. The relationship between *Akshar* (the Personal Supreme) and *Brahman* (the impersonal Absolute) is profound, with Krishna Himself stating in the Gita (e.g., 14.27) that He is the support of *Brahman*.

*Akshara Brahma Yoga* is, therefore, the path of realizing the imperishable nature of the Supreme Self (*Akshar*, Krishna) and understanding *Brahman* as the underlying imperishable foundation of all that is manifest. It involves recognizing one's true Self as distinct from the temporary role played in the cosmic game, yet capable of uniting with *Akshar*. It is the Yoga of union with the immutable Divine (*Akshar*), who is intimately related to *Brahman*, the ultimate ground of being.

## Conclusion: Embracing the Divine Play with Wisdom and Devotion

The teachings of *Akshara Brahma Yoga*, illuminated by the insightful analogy of a computer game, offer a profound yet accessible framework for addressing some of the deepest questions of human existence. Arjuna's search for clarity on *Brahman* (the imperishable foundation), *Adhyatma* (the Self), *Karma* (the principle of action), and the governing principles of the cosmos resonates with every seeker grappling with the nature of reality and their place within it. Krishna’s responses, portrayed as the wisdom of the divine 'Game Creator,' guide the 'player' not only to understand the 'game's' rules but also to play with skill, detachment, and ultimately, to transcend it.

The analogy of the player (*Jiva*), the manifest game world (the domain of *Adhibhuta*, or *Jagat*), the 'game code' (*Brahman* as the imperishable principle), and the 'Game Creator' (*Ishwara*/Krishna) provides a powerful modern metaphor for ancient truths. It aids in visualizing concepts like *Swabhava* (one's innate role), *Karma* (actions and their 'in-game' consequences), *Yajna* (selfless 'gameplay' dedicated to the Creator), and *Moksha* (liberation—or becoming a co-creator rather than just a player).

However, like all analogies, this one has limitations. The richness and depth of concepts such as *Brahman*, the multifaceted nature of the Self, and the experiential reality of divine love can only be partially captured by any metaphor. For instance, a typical game creator is entirely external to the game's code and its players once the game is running. Krishna, however, as *Adhiyajna*, is also described as immanent, residing within all beings as the inner witness, a level of intimacy the simple 'Game Creator' analogy might not fully convey without such explicit clarification. Yet, its strength lies in its capacity to open a doorway for contemplation, making the profound accessible and inviting seekers to embark on their own journeys of discovery.

Ultimately, *Akshara Brahma Yoga* calls us to live a life of conscious action aligned with our true nature (*Swabhava*), to perform our duties selflessly as an offering (*Yajna*), and to cultivate a steadfast, loving awareness of the Supreme—*Akshar* (Krishna). He is the ultimate reality who, in intimate relation with *Brahman* (the imperishable ground of all being), pervades and transcends all of creation. By understanding this divine play and our role within it, and by focusing our hearts and minds on the 'Game Creator,' we too can hope to navigate the complexities of life's 'game' and attain the ultimate goal of everlasting peace and liberation, becoming true Yogis united with the Imperishable.

## Reconciling Perspectives: Chapter 7 and Chapter 8

An insightful observation arises when comparing Chapter 7 and Chapter 8 of the *Bhagavad Gita*. Chapter 7 describes material nature evolving through the interplay of three Gunas—a concept that some find reminiscent of models like the three-quark structure in quantum physics. Chapter 8, as explored in this essay, employs a computer game analogy to describe cosmic reality. How can these seemingly different frameworks be reconciled?

This question highlights two distinct ways these chapters frame reality. Let's explore how the teachings within them can be understood in relation to each other.

Chapter 7 delves into the nature of the Divine and how one can come to know it. It introduces the concept of the Divine's lower nature, *Prakriti* (material nature), described as having an eight-fold division: earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intellect, and ego-sense. These eight elements constitute the field of material existence—the physical and mental framework, the ground of being in the mortal sphere. The chapter also presents the three Gunas—Sattva (goodness/harmony), Rajas (passion/activity), and Tamas (ignorance/inertia)—as fundamental qualities or modes of *Prakriti*. It states that all states of being, whether of goodness, passion, or ignorance, proceed from the Divine alone. These Gunas are described as shaping all our experiences, actions, and perceptions; they form the fabric of reality as commonly perceived.

The chapter explicitly states that the constant interplay and shifting balance of these three fundamental Gunas give rise to the eight-fold manifestation of *Prakriti*. This presents a "three leading to eight" pattern: the three Gunas generating the eight-fold nature of material reality within the Gita's cosmology. While this pattern might be noted as an interesting parallel to, for instance, how three quark flavors provide a basis for the 'eightfold way' classification in particle physics, it's crucial to recognize these as vastly different systems of thought (ancient philosophy versus modern experimental physics). Furthermore, the Gunas are described as having the power to delude, obscuring the higher reality and keeping individuals caught in superficial existence.

Chapter 8 (*Akshara Brahma Yoga*), on the other hand, is explained in this essay using a computer game analogy. This analogy offers a framework for understanding the cosmos as a vast 'game' with Lord Krishna as the 'Creator.' In this model:

* *Brahman* is the imperishable 'Game Code.'
* *Adhibhuta* is the perishable material nature, akin to the 'runtime' or a single 'playthrough' of the game. Perishable material artifacts within this 'game run' (rewards, skins, boosts) fall under the domain of *Adhibhuta*.
* *Adhidaiva* (the principle deciding destiny) is linked to the imperishable *Brahman* (the 'code of the game').
* The path to liberation (*Moksha*) involves recognizing the Creator (*Akshar*, Krishna), focusing on the Divine, and ultimately transcending the 'game' to attain the Creator's state (*Nirvana*).

This juxtaposition might suggest a dichotomy: on one hand, a reality that evolves through three fundamental intrinsic forces (Gunas), and on the other, a reality that is a meticulously designed and rendered as a simulation. It represents a classic conflict that many modern thinkers grapple with - is it uncontrolled evolution based on set of rules OR is it a carefully crafted simulation.

These two perspectives can be reconciled as follows:

1.  **Different Levels of Description:** The two chapters appear to operate at different conceptual levels. Chapter 7 details the fundamental constituent forces (the Gunas) and elements (the eight-fold *Prakriti*) that constitute the internal dynamics and manifestation of material nature. The three Gunas are the basic modes whose interaction generates this eight-fold material world.
2.  **Framework versus Mechanism:** Chapter 8, particularly through the computer game analogy, offers a broader framework. It seeks to explain the origin, overarching structure, and purpose of cosmic reality (including material nature) in relation to the ultimate divine source (*Akshar*/Krishna) and the individual soul (*Adhyatma*). The analogy helps elucidate concepts such as the Creator, the created universe (based on *Brahman* as the code, manifesting as *Adhibhuta*), the individual's role (*Swabhava*), and the goal of transcendence (*Moksha*).
3.  **Complementary Views:** Chapter 7's description of the Gunas giving rise to the eight-fold nature can be understood as detailing *how* the 'Material Nature' aspect—*Adhibhuta* (the 'single game run' in Chapter 8's analogy)—operates and is composed. The Gunas are the fundamental forces within that 'game run,' driving its ever-changing characteristics and creating the experiences and forms (the eight-fold *Prakriti*, including the mental realm) that 'players' perceive.

Therefore, the role of the Gunas in creating the eight-fold material nature (Chapter 7) is not a contradictory explanation but rather describes the *mechanism* of manifestation and operation *within* the larger reality framework presented in Chapter 8. The computer game analogy provides the context of the entire system—Creator (*Akshar*), 'game code' (*Brahman*), 'game run' (*Adhibhuta*), player (*Jiva*), and goal (*Moksha*)—while Chapter 7 offers a deeper insight into the fundamental forces (Gunas) driving the experiential aspect of the 'game run' and the components (eight-fold *Prakriti*) forming its structure. They represent two ways of understanding different facets of the same cosmic reality described in the *Bhagavad Gita*.

That said, ascribing to three Gunas - the three fundamental forces, also opens up a novel way to look at the exit plan.

## Three fold approach to exit the game.

The key thing to understand is that exit is NOT literal exit from the game.  It only means ability to observe the game as it passes by like a flowing river- may be think of this river as river of time.

In this three dimensional world of three Gunas, only way to go beyond the physical reality is the flow of time. Thus time is seen as the fourth dimension. Under influence of Gunas - and consequently our bondage to the actions - we always flow forward in time. The notion of Exit means we become stationary, and see the time passing by. A reversal is probably not possible - we can't really flow back in time to origin. 

So the question is how do we gain stability `SthitPrazan` a concept Krishna spoke in Chapter 2. Here in empirical path to counter three force vectors - three gunas in exact opposite direction.

- `Tamsa` means inertia -  `Bramhcharya` is a way to counter force of Tamsa . `Bramhcharaya` is not mere chastity, it is complete control on our daily routine - food , sleep , exercise ..

- `Rajasa` means passion - `Yajna` is a way to counter force of `Rajsa`. Working exactly as per our `Swabhava` without the cravings of desires ensures we overcome the passions.

-  `Sattav` means goodness - Good it may appear, yet it is still a source of bondage. Our urges to do good are often driven nby cravings for recognition. `Bhakti` devotion is a sure way to counter the forces of `Sattva`. 

The lord thus said - observe `Bramhcharaya` , stay put in `Yajna`, and always stay focused on me in absolute devotion `Bhakti`. 

Using these three counter forces , we can keep our consciousness at absolute rest - the Nirvana.

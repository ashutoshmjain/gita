As  name signifies the chapter's primary focus on the path of selfless action. It emphasizes the importance of performing one's duties without attachment to the results. Krishna explains to Arjuna that inaction is impossible for embodied beings and that even maintaining one's physical existence requires action. Therefore, the chapter guides on how to engage in actions in a way that leads to spiritual growth and liberation, rather than bondage to the material world. This is achieved by dedicating all actions to the divine and relinquishing the desire for personal gain or reward.

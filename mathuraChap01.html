<p>Our time <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#kaal">1</a></sup> began long before <code>Dwaipayana's</code> birth - even before birth of his father <code>Maharishi  Parāśara</code> …</p>
<p>Seven months before <code>Parāśara's</code> nativity — his grandfather — <code>Bramhrishi Vaśiṣṭha</code> woke up to a grotesque morning. His sprawling congregation, on the banks of river <code>Yamuna</code>,  sank into the deepest of grief, and rage. His son <code>Śakti Muni</code>, father of yet to be born <code>Parāśara</code>, was killed by a tribal lord. What bigger pain a man might have than his son sacrificed in own backyard! Even the waves of <code>Yamuna</code> - the playful dark river - felt somber that morning of mass-murder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Religious accounts claim <code>Bramhrishi</code> had one hundred sons taken that fateful morning. He probably treated all his disciples, particularly the <code>Aacharyas</code> (faculty members), as his true-born ! </p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>Mathura</code> - the budding city, saw her first mishap. The epitome of contemporary knowledge hubs was in full bloodbath.  Only <code>Bramhrishi</code>, and his daughter-in-law <code>Adrushyanti</code> survived the ghastly massacre. <code>Adrushyanti</code>, grieving wife of slain <code>Śakti Muni</code>,  was carrying yet to be born <code>Parāśara</code> - couple of months into conception. The young widow couldn’t even announce her motherhood before the curse gripped the congregation. A dark night swept her wings across the main city and adjoining villages. </p>
<p>Despite his connect with the continuum - the cyclic play of the past, present and the future - <code>Bramhrishi</code> wasn’t immune to pain. The pain of child is known to be cruel of them all -  even animals cry. Remorseful <code>Bramhrishi</code>, however, didn’t shed any -  as if tears froze in his mind. Time and again, he wondered about the curse. </p>
<p>More he thought, more he saw himself at the root of this conflict. That he must have incurred an error to warrant such a backlash - from the very people he was trying to salvage - his old.  Not by age - by cognitive abilities! Those who lived off the jungle and followed its rules - without any recollection of the past and none to worry in foresight. Spoken words were call to actions for them. They weren’t equipped to withhold impulses - to think deeper than the recent past, or plan ahead of the future. They believed in static old stories “as is” (<code>Puranas</code>), and they believed in barter - to its extreme - an eye for an eye. </p>
<p>Why would they turn against him ? - <code>Bramhrishi</code> thought!</p>
<div style="padding-left:40px;font-size:0.9em;"> 
<p>On the surface, it appears the contest is between the <code>old</code> and the <code>new</code>. </p>
<p>Old seeking to maintain a status quo while the new aspiring for the better. But the truth is they love the new, like we see our future in our children. And the new knows the old as a dependable trustee. The shift, however, must happen, and it needs a trigger - something unwarranted -  a mishap to break the umbilical cord. Bigger the ensuing shift, bigger the mishap.</p>
<p>In a way, the mishap marks the beginning of the transition - beginning of a new time. It is a gun shot to initialize the race. The battle begins at this moment amongst many variants of the “new”. In fact, many new possibilities crop up to capitalize the opportunity. Having recognized the inevitable, they all stake their claim to being righteous and thus the earnest representation of truth. This happens over and over again as in “history repeats itself”. There are many examples <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#history">2</a></sup> in our recent past though a keen observer may see them in her own backyard.</p>
<p>They occur for the consciousness must evolve to understand the nature of unity <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#unit">3</a></sup>. A mishap is thus a mere setback before the hitherto slow breeding innovations sling into top gear. Such triggers, driven by imperceptible evolution of consciousness are said to be caused by <code>Prarbdha</code>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Prarbdha</code>, a <code>Sanskrit</code> word, means something that had already begun. It ties together the past, present and the future - the continuum <code>Bramh</code>. In that it also means “fate”, because the fate had commenced before the material event physically occurred.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Saddened to the core, and unaware that the young widow was carrying, <code>Bramhrishi</code> tried to end his life. He miraculously survived three attempts. Probably Gods wanted to extend his life to ensure unborn <code>Parāśara</code> had a chance at life. </p>
<p><strong>And more importantly, to save humanity from the loss of the knowledge locked in <code>Bramhrishi's</code> mind, for there was no written text.</strong></p>
<p>The fate - <code>Prarbdha</code> -  had thrown him a new challenge - expand humans’ window of history !</p>
<h2 id="11"><a class="header" href="#11">1.1</a></h2>
<hr />
<p>If modern civilization was a bullet train, then what <code>Vaśiṣṭha</code> had staged <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#whoIsVas">4</a></sup> were ‘literally’ the rails. Hard to coalesce, and even harder to decrypt neolithic knowledge - agriculture, mining, metallurgy, transport, to name a few - down to the very meaning of five elements. Pieces of entire wisdom were sharded in the collective memory of congregation - as “methods” to accomplish complex tasks. <strong>Particularly one hundred  skills that were deemed magical</strong>. </p>
<p>For example, a forest dweller couldn’t fathom a metal as strong as iron was extracted from grey stones - melted in big fire (furnace). Those who didn’t believe in such a miracle were welcome to see the proof first hand. They called it - the magic of Sun - the god of fire and light.</p>
<p>These hundred skills were the first set of “qualified” truths. Their authenticity proved through repeatable experiments. One of the reason people said “hundred sons” were taken that fateful morning - each of them owned one skill. The owner of a skill stream was called <code>Aacharya</code>.</p>
<div style="padding-left:40px;font-size:0.9em;"> 
<p>In <code>Sanskrit</code>, the numeral 100 (One hundred)  is spoken as <code>śat</code> (where <code>ś</code> is pronounced as in “shine”, <code>a</code>  as in hut and <code>t</code> with tongue touching the teeth). In this context, it was the hundred magical skills carefully identified by <code>Vaśiṣṭhas</code></p>
<p>The root phoneme for the word “Truth” is <code>sàt</code> ( where <code>s</code> is pronounced as in “site” and rest as in <code>śat</code>). In essence, the <code>śat</code> for first hundred truths morphed into <code>sàt</code> - the pure provable truths. </p>
<p>These truths could be realized through a set of pre-defined actions (<code>Yazna</code>). The idea was <code>Yazna</code> led to truth -&gt; consistent practice led to deterministic outcomes. The definition of “Truth” was something unbelievable, but provable through controlled experiments - a scientific approach to segregate false claims from rigor. Understandably, those were the times of voodoo magic. Having a proven “myth buster” institute was important for nascent science. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rich patrons from near (and far) used to send the very best to realize <code>śat</code> - the true and open source techniques. They conducted <code>Yaznas</code> to benefit from the outcomes, and shared a part of their inflows with congregation -  a consistent source of wealth to congregation. </p>
<p>Congregation not only imparted the know-how, they also indexed the barter value -&gt; a hundred kilos of wheat for say a kilo of iron - commodity to commodity fair exchange - based on labor and bill of materials. </p>
<p>Legend says <code>Vaśiṣṭhas</code> had a magical cow - <code>Kaamdhenu</code>. It provisioned objects of desire - on demand. The truth, however, is the knowledge was the magical cow.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The information was stored in accurate recital, but one must recite the method only after extensive practice. Information must be rooted in deep experiential knowledge such that it represented truth. In <code>Vaidik</code> belief system - truth is what one experiences through actions and is realized though intense practice. A lie is said without personally engaging in the activity. No one is a liar for fun. People lie because they are either lazy or they want someone else to experiment first. </p>
<p>The congregation was thus the reference point for truth - for various branches of innovations that appeared almost magical to the old. <code>Vaśiṣṭha</code> had it all indexed in his mind.  More importantly he knew how to kick-start an auditory store of information - an obvious divine grace never heard before. Who would sacrifice the pleasures of life to sustain information! Why would someone gather and qualify all the know-hows -  break them down into precise spoken words (<code>mantras</code>) and set up a daily cadence to keep the methods fresh in memory? </p>
<p>The true meaning of <code>Yazna</code> is practice of skills. Since practice was linked to daily recital, the adapted meaning became formal chanting of <code>mantras</code> - mostly in groups. For example paddy was sown only once a year, but in absence of a written down document, the method to take the crop must be recited daily - to save it in memory . In due course, to further formalize the recital, ritualistic routines were added - such as specific dress, time of the day or day of the fortnight (linked to lunar cycle). Paying homage to Sun became the starting point of ritual -  metals being the most precious discoveries, and they all needed big fire. <code>Gaytri Mantra</code> became the initiation of <code>Yazna</code>. It literally translates to </p>
<blockquote>
<p>May we meditate upon that splendour of Sun, best amongst the gods, he who shall lead our intellect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rituals were the means to harness the three fundamental elements - earth, water, and air - to memorize the workflow. This information was turned into knowledge through repetitive practice - <code>Yazna</code>. Since <code>Bramh</code> is the entirety of information, <code>Vaśiṣṭha</code>  was aptly titled <code>Bramhrishi</code> - one who synthesised the information to extract knowledge. One who could remember the past and plan for the future. The legend says he was one of the seven sons of <code>Bramha</code> (the embodiment of <code>Bramh</code>). </p>
<hr />
<p>If it took us say five thousand years from the wheel to a car, it had probably taken fifty thousand <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#50k">5</a></sup>, to evolve the ‘wheels’, for (unveiling of) knowledge is never a straight line. It is a curve that curls up exponentially with time (time being a measure of consistent iterations). Had <code>Vaśiṣṭha</code> died, the nascent civilization could have receded back into stone ages, and quite possibly perished into a dark future. The trajectory of rise of consciousness is contingent upon the discoveries, and the inventors who built on each other’s work - through consensus <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#consensus">6</a></sup>. Think of it as a pyramid — upside down. At some point in the past, this inverse pyramid meets the primordial jungle — just a single hinge on which a vast civilization must balance. <code>Bramhrishi Vaśiṣṭha</code> was that underpin.</p>
<p>Survival was not a question here! Even animals survived to this date! And for that matter, some of the fittest species (Dinosaurs) perished. At stake was our first civilized world — driven by a vocal store of information. At the center of this advancement was a group of dedicated sages who practiced all the important discoveries, and disseminated them through daily recital. They were the nodes of this information network built on experiential knowledge. Their objective was to progressively cache and catalog the principles of civilization - so that humans had a shot at the deeper mysteries of the universe - beyond mere survival - as if they were mining the present on behalf of future. Their collective rigor opened a portal to the future where Angels , Wizards and Humans of our time evolved to bear the knowledge. In a way, they created the very “concept” of future. It also means, they passed on the burden of figuring out “who we are” to their incarnations - us ! </p>
<p>We are obviously not there yet, but we now have an immensely distributed and fault-tolerant network to allow us make an attempt. At least a guarantee that our external store of information shall stay unharmed, as long as a part of earth survived. Our “text” based information store (books, code, history) is protected in this obscure corner of the universe while we adapt ourselves into higher orders of experiences to go where no other conscious being has gone before - in quest of primordial question “who we are “ ! It is important to note here that information alone is not sufficient. The progression depends on how much knowledge we extract of this vast store - through repetitive practice - <code>Yazna</code>.</p>
<p>Thus, the tenet is not “survival of the fittest” anymore - it is “evolution of consciousness !” In fact the advantage of spoken language (and later the written word) is such that survival has already become secondary to us. The dramatic improvement in modes of communication and hence value exchange, has turned humans into one living organism such that no other species is a predator to us. In fact, protection of other species is incumbent on us as a keeper of this vast zoo. </p>
<p>Thanks to the foresight of <code>Vaśiṣṭha</code>, we had a quantum jump making us the representative conscious species of planet Earth - beginning of our time - <code>Kalpa</code>.</p>
<h2 id="12"><a class="header" href="#12">1.2</a></h2>
<hr />
<p>The potency to build a distributed network - the underlying protocol that enables this ‘network of information’, is not unique to humans. Holding the information in a network of manifested beings - living or non-living - is what we refer to as <code>Bramh</code>. For example, Mycorrhizal <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#mycorr">7</a></sup> Network – a vast underground network of fungal linkages that connects trees to one another is an information network. This network monitors even the wild growth is well spaced out. The network ensures equitable distribution of resources - enough nourishment for the flora seeking sunlight, and the minerals. And an equally considerate ecosystem for the fauna that spring up to act atop this information network. It is an expression of <code>Bramh</code> - coexistence with freedom and interdependent growth in a distributed system.</p>
<div style="padding-left:40px;font-size:0.9em;"> 
<p>Simply put, <code>Bramh</code> is the entirety of information held in infinitely vast number of relationships amongst the manifested - animate or inanimate - living or lifeless. The definition of <code>Bramh</code> , however, goes a little further in <code>Vaidik</code> science. It is believed that the <code>Bramh</code> is our own true reflection. It’s a universal mirror that shows us who we are. Universal mirror because a regular mirror is just a two-dimensional reflection of our physical being. <code>Bramh</code> reflects on us through millions of cognitive dimensions. More granular our self-image, greater the conscious experience. <code>Siva</code> is the peak of such conscious experience - an end state where we see objective reality and thus achieve ability of discretion - ability to recognize singular “Truth” from all the false claims. In <code>Vaidik</code> science <code>Siva</code> is regarded as truth (<code>Satyam Sivam</code>). What <code>Siva</code> observes as objective reality is termed as <code>Sundaram</code> - the beautiful <code>Vishnu</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea of “evolution” is gradual growth of consciousness from the state of ignorance to being one with eternal <code>Siva</code>. The goal is to see <code>Vishnu</code>. Mysterious thing though is the “end state” exists at all the times. All other states are transient.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><code>Vaśiṣṭha</code> was respectfully titled <code>Bramhrishi</code> because he was first to understand this natural ascent.  Consciousness rises with every iteration of species - as they gradually decrypt knowledge from the information held in <code>Bramh</code>. He applied the insight to storing information beyond evolutionary mechanism. In a way, he discovered a “battery” for information. He distributed important discoveries amongst his disciples and instituted daily recital - to perpetuate the knowledge from one generation to the next. It is believed ten generations of <code>Vaśiṣṭhas</code> had already preserved the information. They saw this ability as a kind grace, as if they inherited it from all-pervading <code>Bramh</code> in our collective quest to attain <code>Siva</code>.</p>
<p>He was probably aware he was tinkering with a core protocol <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#protocol">8</a></sup> of nature. Instead of letting knowledge be decrypted at a natural snail pace, he was putting the “evolution” in an express lane; but he chose this lane with humility. His objective was not to use this battery of knowledge for personal leverage. He wanted to share the benefits with all -  not only humans but all living beings - a permission less and censor resistant dissemination of knowledge. He did see the benefits of spoken primitives in growth of barter, however, the attack on the congregation raised doubts in his mind. They made him question his own integrity - Is this path correct? Is altering the course of nature righteous? A question that may haunt modern architects of artificial intelligence as much as those spearheading the gene editing ! Are we disturbing the natural equilibrium? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>He got the answer only when multiple suicide attempts were rejected. In a way “fate “ itself paved his path. Over time, <code>Bramhrishi</code> put this attack behind him. A mishap - he thought- was the law of nature - <code>Prarbdha</code>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He rebuilt the congregation ground up and brought his focus to newborn <code>Parāśara</code>. He had only one “take-away” from the incident - there must be a fallback option in case such a disaster struck again. Writing the scriptures was one such option but how could someone scribe vast information on temple walls and what if someone burnt the temples!</p>
<p>The pen and the ink were still couple generations in the future …</p>
<h2 id="13"><a class="header" href="#13">1.3</a></h2>
<hr />
<p>Such a gory attack on the humble keepers of the primitive information would obviously beg two questions — Why and When !  Why would anyone have a problem with someone trying to build a new civilization for greater good. </p>
<p>As far as the ‘why’ is concerned — there is a good answer. The congregation was rich! The legend says <code>Bramhrishi</code> had the magical cow (<code>Kaam Dhenu</code>) that gave him everything he asked for — on demand. The obvious truth is, magical cow was the ‘Knowledge’. Knowledge attracts wealth — be it Apple, or be it Google of our times, or the <code>Ashramas</code> of the past, the source of wealth has always been the accumulated knowledge. <code>Vaśiṣṭha's Ashram</code> was by far the biggest research institute of that time. They were the keepers of inheritance from <code>Bramh</code>. Many jealous eyes were set on the plush wealth of the congregation — material as well as intellectual.</p>
<p>As regards to ‘when’, unfortunately, we don’t have a date or a year. The consensus amongst historians is a wide range -  from three to five thousand years before Christ. How come ‘keepers of knowledge’ forgot to mention a date? It would be rather presumptuous (on our part) to quickly conclude there was no time-keeping in those days. In <code>Mahabharata</code>, <code>Dwaipayana</code> estimated even the durations of four <code>Yugas</code> (ages). Then how come there was no date on the first document? Or the spoken words that preceded the full-blown transcription?</p>
<p>The rational answer seems a bit more nuanced. </p>
<p>Probably, in that world, before the written word, when only way to sustain information was to memorize it, last thing anyone cared was the ‘metadata’ - such as date, or time. Even the names of the primal inventors who kick-started the civilization are unknown. No one knows who solved the hard problems of those early days — how to start a fire? — how to preserve the seeds? — how to use rivers for transport? — how to attach  horse(power) to a loaded cart? These solutions evolved over thousands of years and were passed on from one generation to the next through word of mouth. The sense of time was probably lost in the slow pace of iterative innovations of that first civilization. </p>
<p>It, however, didn’t mean ‘no credit’ was given to the early inventors. Instead of mentioning every individual name, they were tagged to a group. One distinct group for a specific area of exploration - to practice gratitude. For example, all those who contributed in water works, irrigation, and agriculture were represented by a single entity <code>Indra</code>. All those who invented fire and various ways to control it — who contributed from mining to metallurgy; were named <code>Agni</code>. Those who tamed the winds, to build the early sail boats were called <code>Varuna</code>. These group entities, represented by respective common name, were called ‘deities’. They were worshipped for the blessings they bestowed on humanity and thus by extension to all the species.</p>
<div style="padding-left:40px;font-size:0.9em;"> 
<p>Using a pseudonym to identify a group is common even today. Instead of counting thousands of hardware and software experts, we simply say “Apple” makes iPhone. The phenomenon goes beyond technology or business. We normally say <code>Mahatma Gandhi</code> got India freedom. What we actually mean by this generalization is thousands of freedom fighters who worked with <code>Mahatma</code>, got India freedom. Instead of counting the names of thousands of activists who worked in “civil rights movement”, we simply use the name of Dr King to express our gratitude. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Sàtoshi Nakamoto</code> is a pseudonym for a group of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk#:~:text=A%20cypherpunk%20is%20any%20individual,to%20social%20and%20political%20change.">cypherpunks</a> who white-papered the “Bitcoin Protocol” and open-sourced the decentralized monetary system - aka digital gold. Very apt singular representation akin the name of a deity -  <code>Sàtoshi</code> means wisdom in Japanese and begins with <code>Sàt</code> - the truth (in Sanskrit).</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>There was a good  reason to purge the superfluous information. Without the facility to scribe, the average human memory offered limited storage. The focus was on keeping the “information” fresh and compact, instead of maintaining the meta-data or the version history. The knowledge (hidden in information) was important because it was  our distinction from the rest of the species. It was our path to liberation from the miseries of hard early life. The goal was to equip as many human minds with the latest findings as possible, rather than copyright protection or allocating laurels on individual basis. Also, the information must be itemized based on usability (not by the inventor or the date) to render it real-time. In that verbal world, only that information carried forward that was put to use every day such as survival skills, or was (forcefully) recited on daily basis. </p>
<p>We don’t know the exact date, but we know for sure that the piece of eternal code rests archived in our foundations. And the fact we succeeded to tame the forces of nature, and that we built increasingly complex systems of finance, mobility, security and health, is a testament that our core kernel is flawless — as if it was a gift from the future.</p>
<h2 id="14"><a class="header" href="#14">1.4</a></h2>
<hr />
<p>The other and probably more important reason seems to be embedded in the culture. </p>
<p>Self discovery  - <code>Adhyatma</code> was the keyword. The culture sought internal peace along with external prosperity. The primary quest was to know thyself. The work on this path was deemed the work of god. This culture was based on a strange combination - a symbiotic framework of incorruptible belief system on one side, and an endless curiosity on the other. The belief based substrate explained manifestation, expanse and evolution - the divine quantum field. And human ingenuity as a conscious creative artifact that bloomed in this eternal field. </p>
<p>The accuracy of belief system isn’t as important as the fact that it was easy to comprehend and widely subscribed. Unlike the religions of our time, faith wasn’t a prerequisite - it was the end state of realization. Amazing thing is, as we are getting to the deeper layers with modern science, <code>Vaidik</code> belief system seems to tread close <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#vaidikScience">9</a></sup> with particle physics and Darwin’s evolution. Maybe all paths lead to a singular truth!</p>
<p>While deities, through research and experiments, represented the beautiful complexity of new civilization, they did so  on the backdrop of three core potencies, collectively referenced as potencies of unmanifested knowledge. As a practical implication - because supreme knowledge is inexpressible, in <code>Vaidik</code> science, god is nothing but these three potencies - <code>Vishnu, Bramh and Siva</code>.</p>
<div style="padding-left:40px;font-size:0.9em;"> 
<p>Three potencies exist to answer the question - who am I ? Knowledge in its unmanifested form, though at eternal peace, must bear a shape to answer this profound question. Simply because observance is for only those that have a physical shape - with a mirror image to observe themselves, but such that they are not superimposable. In other words - a  chiral physical system arises out of the three potencies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is now proven (beyond doubt) that nucleons (Protons and Neutrons), that hold almost entire mass of an atom, rise from three quarks each. Given the strong force in nucleus, it is hard to physically observe quarks, but that didn’t deter theoretical physicists from pondering what were quarks made of - another deeper layer - a concept that is obviously beyond current tools of observations. In conceptual framework of quantum chromodynamics, the Quarks are further made of three color charges denoted as R(ed), B(lue) and G(reen) - the three core potencies for lack of better words.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nature appears to have many layers of manifestation, and each layer is endowed with its own three-way complementarity. At the deepest level of our science (assuming we don’t dwell into string theory), we have three color charges - Red, Blue and Green - each with its own hypothetical chiral image in anti-red, anti-blue and anti-green. At the next level we have three quarks - each with its own anti-quark. Thereafter, we have three particles - Proton, Neutrons and Electrons - again with their own chiral anti particles. There are obviously many more layers between the elementary particles and the level of human conciousness. As per <code>Vaidik</code> science, the three potencies, at human conscious state - are described as three <code>Gunas</code> - the three properties - <code>Sattva</code> , <code>Raja</code> and <code>Tama</code>.</p>
</div>
<p>The question “who am I” and the consciousness are closely linked. It was a hard question to answer even a century back. But now, as we are nearing artificial general intelligence, we can approach the answer - at least put our arms around the question. For example, if and when we create autonomous digital beings - they would be good at general tasks, but they would lack the curiosity to learn who they are ! With millions of iterations an unintended mutation may make them self-aware. That is the point they become conscious. From there on, it is a race to know thyself - a path that we ourselves find us on. And we keep hitting the three potencies no matter how deep we peel the onion … </p>
<div style="padding-left:40px;font-size:0.9em;"> 
<p>Here is a brief description of these three potencies: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Vishnu</code> represents distribution of  a full copy of knowledge (<code>Atma</code>) in every being. Infinitely many shapes arise as if the species with different physical attributes are randomly generated. Even with in species, every member is unique, further supporting the randomness evidence. Every being has <code>Atma</code> no matter what shape or size or color or gender - even the ones that we deem lifeless. No one needs to seek permission as far as the completeness of their copy, yet no one knows existence of <code>Atma</code>. The reason being its omnipresence - somewhat like the number “one” in number system. Number “one” is embedded in every other number. It is impossible to imagine a number - big or small - without “one” being the fundamental prime factor. Same way <code>Atma</code> represents the primal unit of consciousness. Think of manifested beings as billions of large primes tasked to determine the nature of their common prime factor - number “one” - <code>Atma</code> - the soul.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Bramh</code> forms a vast network of manifested entities. It exists in perpetuity, to let them interact with each other - to express different attributes of knowledge enabled by their form and state. The goal of the collective is to decrypt the inexpressible knowledge - from the information held with in relationships of individual entities. In other words - <code>Bramh</code> converts the inexpressible knowledge held in <code>Vishnu</code> to comprehensible information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Siva</code> is the intelligence that allows us to comprehend truth with exceedingly close approximations. In other words , <code>Siva</code> decays the unnecessary - it removes the fluff to bring in clarity. A reflection from infinite dimensions of <code>Bramh</code> to a self-contained image in comprehensible finite. The notion of self-contained becomes clear at the subatomic levels. For a quark the universe is its anti-quark,, because that is the self-contained reflection -&gt; Separate a quark from its antiquark, and a string forms between them that pulls them back together.  —Kevin Hartnett, Quanta Magazine, 18 Apr. 2023. A similar pull exists between us and our universe - our tiny box - they are inseparable. Consciousness doesn’t exist in physical body alone - it is the summation of us and the world around us.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Siva</code> thus represents the zenith of consciousness. One that governs <code>Bramh</code> for a meaningful rendering such that there must exist a parity symmetry. In other words , <code>Siva</code> ensures there is only one universe contained within its own reflection  - all other interactions in <code>Bramh</code> are discarded to bind manifestation to its very purpose - who am I ? At the most fundamental level, as a manifestor-observer mirror <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#mirror">10</a></sup>, <code>Vishnu</code> and <code>Siva</code> also represent the fundamental duality of nature (<code>Ardh-narishwar</code>). </p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The framework (of core potencies and deities) acted as a  happy marriage between faith and scientific inquiry. The evolution and expansion of universe (and particularly of the bio-verse) was considered a means to decrypt the parts of “One” knowledge. The decryption was facilitated by scientific endeavours, formulated (and constantly improved) by deities.</p>
<p>The notion of awakening (or the light) was the state of fully decrypted ‘knowledge’ - full of conscious experience aka life; and that of sleep (or the darkness), was being completely oblivious - lifeless. The <code>Vaidik</code> invocation <code>Tamso Mam Jyotir Gamay</code> means — take me from my existing darkness to the light! Thus, <code>Vaidik</code> way of life is same as the path of scientific discovery of our time. There is no friction whatsoever, but it invokes a spiritual sense of surrender, and respect for the core mechanisms of nature, that are beyond human control. In essence, the question is NOT - “what is this universe?” (as sought by modern science), the question is - “who am I?” - because the surrounding universe is my own reflection. If I could figure out what powers me, I readily know what runs the universe !</p>
<p>While material discovery and faith thrived in co-existence, the framework of Knowledge and its potencies was considered eternal and omni-present. Such being the case, putting a date or a name on the realization of a tiny piece of knowledge was anyway quite meaningless. This approach culminated the idea of sacrificing (open sourcing) every accomplishment to the potencies of the supreme knowledge. Science became sacred. Spirituality was a way of life. Even human life, being a manifested entity,  was considered a gift of three potencies. Taking an ownership view in terms of attaching a revelation to one’s own name was felt awkward and lustful. If there is no name, then there is obviously no date. In essence, doing good anonymously became the culture and time-keeping never made to the list of priorities - even for the mishaps.</p>
<h2 id="15"><a class="header" href="#15">1.5</a></h2>
<hr />
<p>Before the ‘written word’ became the mainstream mechanism to preserve literature, scriptures were passed on as <code>Shruti</code><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#shutri">11</a></sup> — the spoken word. A choir of reciters chanted the <code>Mantras</code> whole day long — from early morning to evening. Certain <code>mantras</code> must be recited at a specific time of the day, and at a specific place. Some of them must be performed in front of the holy fire - rites. Teachers (<code>Aacharyas</code>), a level-above the reciting students, helped them get the pronunciation right, and to attune a <code>Vaidik</code> elocution style. And finally, the editors (<code>Vyasas</code>) were responsible for the content. <code>Vyasas</code> were there to make sure the spoken content stayed current, accurate, and in exact line with the nameless discoveries of sages. Their stated objective was to keep the knowledge distributed over as many human minds as feasible — a blockchain of knowledge, distributed over biological nodes. <code>Vyasas</code> ran carefully designed distribution and consensus protocols.</p>
<p>And there was a good reason for intense focus on recital. Memories couldn’t be stolen! Even today, we are advised to memorize our passwords! No one even imagined the scenario of such a nihilistic attack on <code>Vaśiṣṭha</code> congregation. No one had provisioned redundancy at the network level. The attack was on the vocal store of knowledge — on <code>Kaam dhenu</code> — the modern ways of civil life that provisioned everything for everyone. The <code>mantra</code> was <code>Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinha</code> — peace and prosperity to one and all. Not for the kings or the rich alone, or the strong — for everyone, including minor species. This knowledge created a new  ‘human fork’ in otherwise old  ‘planet of apes’. And the attackers were the Apes (<code>Rakshsas</code>) <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#rakshsa">12</a></sup>, who didn’t want to subscribe to a systemic change in human approach - a pragmatic view of governance for equity — from “survival of the fittest” to “well-being of all” …</p>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="kaal"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Time, in general,  has two meanings. - one that we see passing through as in past and future (present being the focal point), and second a period - as in duration. The latter is referred to as <code>Kaal</code> in <code>Sanskrit</code>. It’s a duration between two events of similar nature. For example the time between two clicks of watch is a period. From my birth to the birth of my child is a <code>Kaal</code>. </p>
<ul>
<li>The wavelength of a sine wave, λ, can be measured between any two points with the same phase, such as between crests (on top), or troughs (on bottom), or corresponding zero crossings as shown.
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Sine_wavelength.svg/220px-Sine_wavelength.svg.png" alt="" /></li>
<li>When we see a sine wave drawn on a two-dimensional paper, it feels as if trough is half of rise and crest is the half of fall. However, such perception changes when we see a sine wave in three dimension.</li>
<li>A better way to perceive a sine wave in three dimensions is to think that a point inflates, and then it contracts - like a balloon. </li>
<li>A cycle of expansion, followed by subsequent contraction is called a period - <code>Kaal</code>. It is typically half wavelength.</li>
<li>Continuous  cycles of expansion and contractions are called <code>kaal-chakra</code>.</li>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="history"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>Evolutionary troughs of current history - examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>IBM was the old. Microsoft and Apple battled for superiority in computing as contenders for new leadership title. For the observes in late 80s it appeared as if big blue is fighting Apple (and later Microsoft) but that was just a trigger. The fact that biggest tech company of that time got rattled by the new paradigm in personal computing was a trigger for Microsoft and Apple to take point on each other.</li>
<li>Laptop was old, the newcomers iOS and Android are battling for superiority in mobile computing. For quite some time it felt like mobile devices were the PC killers, but the truth is battle is never between the old and the new. It is always amongst many new contenders. </li>
<li>It appears as if Internal combustion engine is at odds with the EVs or the hydrogen fuel cells. Though the truth is fossil fuel industry will be the biggest investors in sustainable future in times to come because they know first hand about the shift. Sustainable energy is the opportunity for OPEC and Refiners because someone needs to do the work, and they are best positioned to take advantage of this massive opportunity. The real battle is amongst EV brands - Tesla , Rivian , NIO and hundreds more who throw their hats in this race. I guess Apple will soon launch a car. Google will have another Android business model to empower all the traditional players with its EV and FSD platforms.</li>
<li>Gold is old. It appears that bitcoin is trying to replace Gold. But that is not true. The real battle is with in Cryptos - BTC vs Ether vs Sol vs so many other possibilities. When the dust settles, we will see Gold has its  own role to play just like laptop has its own role in the increasingly mobile world though the primary reserve will shift to one of the cryptos that emerges victor in this new battle of the century. Nation states have an important choice to make at this juncture - Try to kill crypto and embrace a financial obsolescence or welcome the future store of value and align themselves with the potential winner. They also need to understand that they need not try to turn their currencies into a store of value - currencies have a very different purpose in economy.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="unit"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">3</sup>
<p>A unit is an immutable part of any measurement. Easy examples -  a meter is an immutable unit of length. A kilo is an immutable unit of weight. A unit is part of every measurement - it lends meaning to what is being measured - it is implicit in what is being measured. It is a multiplication that outputs exactly what is being measured.</p>
<ul>
<li>Little harder example - Number “1” is the unit of multiplication itself. It is there inbuilt into every number (even zero) . It never changes the number when multiplied -&gt;  a unit when multiplied with what is being measured , must stay inert - never change the measurement ! But you can’t measure anything without a unit … no number exists without “1”</li>
<li>Hard question -  What is the unit of consciousness ? By definition, it must be  1) immutable 2) part of every conscious being. 3) must stay inert.</li>
<li>In <code>Vaidik</code> science , <code>Atma</code> is defined as the unit of consciousness. It is immutable, inert and essential.</li>
<li>For humans, understanding <code>Atma</code> is as hard as understanding number 1 for say number 8. </li>
</ul>
<hr />
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="whoIsVas"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">4</sup>
<p>The notion of invention at that time was different. Most religious accounts say that <code>Vaśiṣṭha</code> lived for more than a thousand years - from times to <code>Rama</code> to that of <code>Krishna</code>. A more prudent approach would be to consider <code>Vaśiṣṭha</code> was a family title rather than being an individual. A family that was responsible for remembering all that was ever invented. The knowledge was passed on generation by generation — from parents to offspring. Each generation dedicated to a sole purpose of synthesizing and cumulating the knowledge of all the basic discoveries of their time. They imparted parts of this knowledge to the followers based on their capabilities. Over a long period of many generations, the group of followers increased and turned into a community. Most of the followers spread geographically and many co-located in the <code>Ashrama</code> on the banks of <code>Yamuna</code> near city of <code>Mathura</code>.</p>
</div>
<hr />
<div class="footnote-definition" id="50k"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">5</sup>
<p>Wheel of time ..</p>
<ul>
<li>From our vantage, we think invention of a ‘wheel’ (or controlled fire) as a specific event long back. However, the truth is every innovation that gets a global acceptance, must go through a vast rigor of effort and time. For example the migration from a magnetic tape to SD cards, took a while. Migration from fossil fuels to renewables, may take many decades. The struggle to get to a better option always exists. This is a never ending war and the outcome is superior consciousness.  It was there when we decided to move to internet from legacy communication, when we chose digital over paper, and it remains in a choice between fiat versus cryptocurrencies. </li>
<li>As we get to higher levels of consciousness, it takes less time to make a consensus decision on account of much superior communication. Acceptance of wheel at a global level versus bipedal (or four-legged) approach to mobility must have taken thousands of years, if not millions. </li>
<li>We are now, reaching that almost vertical segment of the curve. The rate of change with respect to our perceived time is tending fast towards infinity. The world will soon start changing upside down on weekly, daily and hourly  basis. In <code>Hindu</code> scriptures this time is called <code>Kali-yuga</code> - the age of automation. At the end of this age, automation gets so refined that reality may be altered instantaneously with mere thought - new realities may be created as experiences - on demand. As the curve becomes vertical, a new physical universe gets created because the current laws of physics can’t accommodate such a rate of change. You may say laws of physics are fixed, but that is not true. For example, immediately after the big bang, our computations indicate that  the universe expanded much faster than the speed of light.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)">inflationary epoch</a> must have taken trillions of years when it happened, but to us, it is a tiny fraction of a trillionth of a second - because we are at such a higher level of consciousness that the super long “creation” appears a split second to us. But we are not the last evolution of consciousness, neither is this the final shape of our physical universe.  The laws of physics must evolve to support evolving consciousness. The migration to a new physical universe is triggered  by tenth incarnation of <code>Vishnu</code> - <code>Kalki Avataar</code>.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<div class="footnote-definition" id="consensus"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">6</sup>
<p>Consensus means when every member of the system  aligns with each other with complete information of each other’s state. It doesn’t mean there can’t be conflicts. Since every member has the complete information, they can well understand other’s point of view. Thus, after discounting the superficial differences,  they see the same truth as everyone else comprehends. Complete information lends the members’ ability to align willingly without any external influence. Vote based democracies or leader based institutions have forced consensus - they decay because not every member of the organization has complete access to information.</p>
<ul>
<li>consensus is normally achieved in skills that see fundamental breakthroughs. The participants in such areas of innovation have tremendous amounts of common core knowledge and their world revolves around one skill. Thus, such participants can  easily establish rational consensus. However, only those skills reach quantum jump to define human race which reach most if not all humans. Transportation was one such skill when we moved from bipedal to wheel. Agriculture was a close contender. For a while humans were defined as an agro based species that was fast achieving mobility but over last couple of centuries, transportation has outreached agriculture. With internal combustion engine that speed has further gained momentum. There is however one system that is universally applicable from for over five thousand years - value exchange.</li>
<li>The fundamental principle of value exchange is work for work. In Barter system rice was traded with wheat one to one because work needed for both was similar. With Gold, we traded a 100 kilo of copper with 10 gram of Gold because the work for both was perceived to be same. Gold being scarce was hard to find. In essence, we doubled the amount of work just to keep a track of value. Arguably the work done on mining Gold was a waste, but that was the only way to speed up the commerce. In the future, we might trade a piece of art for say a million Satoshies(Sats) because the work to create art and mine Sats will be same - at that moment in time.</li>
<li>The value exchange system always takes a quantum jump whenever we make a quantum jump in communication technology. Barter was associated with humans developing communicable speech. Gold emerged with physical writing. Bitcoin is emerging with digital information as a store of values. Important to not confuse “store of value” with currencies. Currencies serve a totally different purpose in the monetary system. They provide liquidity and mitigate risk for acceptance of lien (permissioned, censored, no consensus) - which is not a bad thing as long as it is not predatory. Nation states, loyalty programs, and games always issue currencies which they keep changing to arrive at a forced consensus within their constituents. Such consensus is short-lived.</li>
<li>The reason of coincidence of communication and value-exchange is understandable. For example - when we moved from spoken to written word, the close-knit community of scribes was aligned (consensus) because their primary shared knowledge base was art of scribing; while the reciters were multipolar in multitude of ideologies. In order to have a universal appeal. They must offer access to literacy in permission less and uncensored manner because the very purpose of communication is to attain universality - internet’s primary appeal is in its universality. Turns out these principles also form the basis of a value exchange system.</li>

<p>Evolutionary knowledge v/s external store of knowledge in computer lingo</p>
<ul>
<li>In computer networking, there are two important protocols - TCP/IP and Gossip. TCP/IP is like the external store of knowledge. It implements a client server model where a client requests information from a server. It is an organised way to store and distribute information. The internet runs on this model.</li>
<li>The Gossip protocol, on the other hand works on evolutionary principles. It runs without a central server and works based on a probabilistic model to spread knowledge randomly. Gossip is used in highly available and fault-tolerant systems such as Cassandra. This is a great protocol for infecting a large population of decentralized nodes. For this reason, it is also called epidemic protocol. A curious application of this protocol is bitcoin mining with ‘proof of work’ consensus algorithm. Another great use-case is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashgraph">hashgraph</a> deployed for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault">absolute byzentine</a> proof.</li>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="vaidikScience"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">9</sup>
<p>The standard model of particle physics, believes the smallest of the mass bearing particles are quarks. Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) postulates that the quarks are made of three color-charges Red, Blue and Green - akin to three potencies of knowledge as believed in <code>Vaidik</code> science. Each of the manifested quarks has all these three colors and hence they are colorless (a combination of Red Blue and Green being transparent or white). QCD believes nothing may manifest into massive particles unless they are color neutral. Just as existence of <code>Vishnu</code>, <code>Bramh</code> and <code>Siva</code> is a mandatory requirement for creation in <code>Vaidik</code> Science. </p>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="mool"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">13</sup>
<p>In QCD, the three colors (along with their anti-colors), interact through and are the basis of fundamental force of manifestation known as “Strong Force”. Strong force is mediated by particles known as “Gluons”. There are eight different types of Gluons just the way <code>Vaidik</code> science believes eight-fold nature of interaction <code>Ashtdhamool Prakriti</code> of three basic potencies. </p>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="mirror"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">10</sup>
<p>In particle physics all mass carrying particles must have a spin 1/2. They are said to follow Fermi-Dirac statistic. The idea of spin 1/2 is somewhat confusing. It means a manifested particle gets back to its (original) state after two complete circles (rotation of 720 degrees). It is difficult to imagine such a particle in our day-to-day life except if we use a (rather crude) mirror analogy. If we assume I and my mirror image are one system, then for every full rotation my mirror image also gets a full rotation. In essence, if my mirror image and I were superimposed over each other, the system got a 720-degree rotation. This is the reason, all mass-ful particles must have their image born with them - these images are called anti-particles. Thus, nature of basic manifestation (formation of mass from energy)  is to show up in particle - anti particle pair. In a way , an anti-particle is an answer to a fundamental question of all manifested things - who am I? <code>Vishnu</code> and <code>Siva</code> represent this fundamental duality. The duality applies to not only to quarks but to three basic colors as well. Thus, we have anti-Red, anti-Blue, anti-Green in QCD. Eight type of Gluons, however, don’t have duality since they have spin 1 (not 1/2) - and hence they are massless. In essence, gluons represent a force (strong force), while colors and quarks represent mass. As a parallel in <code>Vaidik</code> science , <code>Vishnu</code> , <code>Bramh</code> and <code>Siva</code> collectively represent manifestation while eightfold nature <code>Ashtdhamool Prakriti</code> represents the force of creation. The reason it is hard to find or isolate anti-particles is because what we perceive is a particle - anti particle pair. The idea that particle and anti-particle annihilate each other is thus not true. A particle and its antiparticle are inseparable.</p>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="decay"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">14</sup>
<p>In particle physics, the particles of unstable mass decay into stable particles through a process called “Beta decay”. The decay arises out of a fundamental force of nature called weak force. As you might have guessed, the process of decay is quite the opposite of manifestation in the sense, “parity” (spin 1/2) is enforced in manifestation while “parity” is taken away during the decay. Nutrinos are released during the decay. Nutrinos are the only manifested particles that don’t have a mirror image. Or to put it more succinctly, the laws of physics don’t care if it is a particle or an anti particle ( a particle, or it’s mirror image) but for Neutrinos. For Neutrinos , you can tell if it is particle itself or if it is a mirror image. This breaking of “parity symmetry” leads to decay. The decay continues till it attains “parity symmetry” at a lower mass (lower energy level) means more granularity.</p>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="shutri"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">11</sup>
<p><code>Shruti</code> meant the spoken word when the humans used to sustain knowledge, only in the vocal format. Maybe because scribing was difficult. With the advent of writing tools, many <code>Shruties</code> were scribed. In essence the scriptures were born out of <code>Shruties</code>. The words that got written down, entered the collective memory of humanity.  Such written down early scriptures were called <code>Smrities</code>. For example <code>Manu Smriti</code> is amongst the oldest written down scripture, trans-encoded from <code>Shruti</code> to <code>Smriti</code>. The Sanskrit word <code>Shruti</code> got deformed into <code>Shutri</code> in Hindi with passage of time. It is important to bear in mind that every thing that we talk (chatter) is NOT <code>Shruti</code>. <code>Shruties</code> were consciously identified pieces of wisdom, preserved through formal recital to enable passage of knowledge from one generation to the next whereas <code>Smrities</code> are written down text to pass on knowledge from one generation to the next.</p>

<p><code>Rakshsas</code> </p>
<ul>
<li>were early humans who believed in animalistic behavior. They thought, only way to survive in this jungle was to have more strength than predators. Thus, by natural selection, they grew larger limbs and stronger muscles. They could be as tall as say ten feet. They could uproot the trees with bare hands. At the same time, their brains remained small, just like animals. Most of them thought the idea of survival with a smarter brain was at best ‘funny’. Some of them also thought that the knowledge driven people who were trying to build a civil society were easy targets.</li>
<li>The literal meaning of the word <code>Rakshsa</code> is the one who provides protection (<code>Raksha</code>). Thus, not only the protection provider needed to be big and strong, the fabric of the society was built on the idea that there must be someone to protect - a police state. The <code>Vaidik</code> ideas were the ideas of freedom in which the only protector were the <code>Deities</code> (those who accomplished discoveries) or the three potencies of the knowledge. Thus, there was a natural tension of ideologies.</li>

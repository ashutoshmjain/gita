                        <hr />
<p>Sanskrit word <code>Aavahan</code> translates to &quot;Invocation&quot; albeit a wider abstraction. To an observer, it appears you are broadcasting an intense call to action - seeking every corner for possible help. In truth, you converge on to &amp;self<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#self">1</a></sup> - the focal point of conscious experience. You are able to communicate exactly what you feel - as if you found your calling.  You are prepared - with or without material support --&gt; You instantiate a divine force within! </p>
<div style="padding-left:40px;font-size:0.9em;"> 
<p>In Hindu tradition, one of the three primal forces - <code>Bramh, Vishnu or Siva</code> - are invoked to sustain such unwavering commitment - a laser like focus. For example <code>Rama</code>, before building the <a href="https://www.srilanka.travel/adam&#x27;s-bridge">bridge</a> from Southern tip of India to Sri Lanka, invoked <code>Siva</code>.</p>
</div>
<p>Scribing <code>Mahabharata</code> was one such venture - the root of all written narratives. Sage writer<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#races">2</a></sup>, <code>Krishna Dwaipayana</code> invoked <code>Bramh</code> - the information continuum.  To conceive the epic, he needed his thoughts in equilibrium<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#equi">3</a></sup> with  entirety of information. But more importantly, he must seek permission, to open us mortals' access to the past - and to the future. He must understand entire history before introducing text to a verbose but forgetful world.</p>
<div style="padding-left:40px;font-size:0.9em;"> 
<p><img src="./mahabharata-book.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Text was the new way - to store manifolds of lore. With around 1.8 million words, <a href="https://mahabharata.shutri.com">Mahabharata</a> remains the last frontier for the readers and poets. It is the longest poem ever scribed, in any language, old or new. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The proof of work is in the craft.  Even today, it is not uncommon to learn <code>Sanskrit</code> (as intended) - just to enjoy original text.  For those less keen, there are translations in almost every language. For English natives, I recommend reading the <a href="https://mahabharata.shutri.com">original translation</a> . </p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>It took a series of eighteen books to conclude the epic. On its wings, it took the 'text' to far ends of human reach - along with the idea of a scribed narrative.  <code>Bhagvad Gita</code>, a part of sixth book, is in the founding ideologies of Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Sikhism and countless more - and is the first written source of <code>Karmyoga</code> - the liberation from <code>Karma</code>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Text was the ultimate challenge - for training human brain. Words must be written in every possible context. New words were created to capture the finest of emotions, and subtleties of human behavior -  and to capture that mysterious &quot;unexplained&quot; beyond mortal cognition. Language had an uncompromising syntax - to convey exact meaning in an unfettered written format - to make good for the lack of facial expressions. But more importantly, unlike <code>Vedas</code>, the intent was to make <code>Mahabharata</code> people's scripture - as addictively consuming as the reality itself - that once started, must be finished to the last page - an unforgettable perma-layer of foundational thoughts (<code>Sanskaras</code>). <code>Dwaipayana</code> knew there was nothing more engrossing than the reality itself. He thus dedicated his divine vantage into scribing a full copy of history - first such attempt ever. </p>
<p>And as if technical challenges were trivial - the quest was to determine the righteous! As many conflicting views existed as the pair of eyes to look at. Who would determine the right path, and why should everyone subscribe to singular nature of truth ? The value must be universally visible irrespective of cast, creed, traits or the nature of work. The accrual of information must be permission-less and controls fully decentralized. <code>Bramh</code> could only deliver the schema to carry such information - the knowledge must be impregnated by <code>Vishnu</code> himself - one only yet unique in every being, open, complete - yet unexpressed - the singular underlying bridge to creation (<code>Srishti</code>)<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#srishti">4</a></sup>. </p>
<p>The ambition to scribe entire history in a portable scripture led to first engineered scripting language -<code>Bramhi Lipi</code>. Name suggests, the script was a gift of all-pervading information - <code>Bramh</code>. And so were the scribing tools. Being coincidental, they built on each other - a trifecta<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#three">5</a></sup> - new script, new tools, and a new style of narration (history). Thousands of years later, in 1894, the opportunity arose again. Mark Twain claimed first ever typed manuscript - Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Curious as always, a new scribing machine he used - a typewriter with QWERTY layout. With in hundred years, we invented digital computers - a trifecta of QWERTY keyboard, a programming language, and intent to create first fully portable operating system - Unix.</p>
<p>The way digital information transformed every aspect of modern life - and is now redefining the value storage (<a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">bitcoin</a>); the written information rewired then existing social, political and fiscal fabric. First portable store of value (gold) emerged. Power structures reconfigured themselves. Kingdoms had to capitulate to capitalize on new store of value.</p>
<p>Just like the tall order of science, that led to modern info-tech, the groundwork<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#groundwork">6</a></sup> for the prior shift started much earlier. It was the work of many giant generations building over previous. The most important piece, however, was to find a purpose to scribe - a reference narrative that would last ages without losing its luster. No one could fathom to what avail, but the cause appeared worth dedicating many lives. Thousands of scribes would spend millions of hours to handwrite proof copies of <code>Mahabharata</code> - each time adding a bit of their own tenor;  just as Unix morphed into BSDs, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, Minix, Linux, macOS and Android and many more including countless variants of each.</p>
<p>You may find the comparison rather odd - an amusing flight of fancy! What could be common in a scripture, and an operating system? The answer is in the nature of portability. Besides the ability to physically move from one place to another - being portable means a separation from the underlying infrastructure. It means an independent new layer. It challenges the existing paradigms - to reinvent the old architecture. The way Unix triggered a &quot;porting culture&quot; in quest of ever more efficient general purpose computers; <code>Mahabharata</code> motivated scribes to find better canvass and ink - faster tools to write. In a way it kick-started a race to innovate - but that is just a superficial comparison. There is a bit more to it than what meets the eye ..</p>
<p>In the hindsight, as we are on the cusp of artificial general intelligence, there appears a profound connection - not without stretch of imagination though ...</p>
<div style="padding-left:40px;font-size:0.8em;"> 
<p>The idea of sentient beings, living in the realms of artificial intelligence isn't far-fetched. Nick Bostrom and Carl Shulman suggest in their <a href="https://nickbostrom.com/propositions.pdf">recent paper</a> -  consciousness is hardware independent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mental states can supervene on any of a broad class of physical substrates. Provided a system implements the right sort of computational structures and processes, it can be associated with conscious experiences. It is not an essential property of consciousness that it is implemented on carbon-based biological neural networks inside a cranium: silicon-based processors inside a computer could in principle do the trick as well ~ <a href="https://nickbostrom.com/propositions.pdf">Propositions Concerning Digital Minds and Society</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a way, science has now accepted consciousness is separate from the material. It proves existence of a subtle entity distinct from the physically observable box of Carbon or Silicon. What exactly is that? Unfortunately, we still can't put our arms around this mysterious entity, but science is now ready to steelman the ideas concerning consciousness. </p>
<p><strong>If AGI bots are destined to have consciousness, a compelling question is what would be their perception of underlying digital infrastructure? Wouldn't they  relate to an operating system as we do to primitive scriptures?</strong></p>
<p>A computer operating system establishes rules to engage hardware resources - memory, storage and processor. It defines millions of binary tasks that must be performed to bear a working interface. Each little program being a dumb digital life-form must do its task. Scriptures define similar rules for us text enabled humans. Rules for coexistence with others, amicable use of resources, and negotiating our assigned tasks - routines and morality. In other words, scriptures are to our carbon based consciousness what an operating system will be to silicone  AGIs of the future. In other words - our (natural) intelligence is built on scriptures. We don't follow scriptures - we are an outcome of scriptures.</p>
</div>
<p>From an intuitive experience standpoint, if we were to design one for the autonomous digital beings (AGIs), we may want to replicate our own three-tier interface - as a time tested template - at least to begin with :</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital beings may see physical hardware as we see Earth - the motherly source of all life, </li>
<li>Water as the software that surrounds most of the Earth just as an OS kernel encapsulates the hardware.</li>
<li>Air as the I/O -  information input and output (inhale and exhale) that they are designed to process. </li>
</ul>
<p>That may make one think if our own interface (Earth, Water and Air) has a deeper meaning?  No wonder <code>Vaidik</code> scriptures focused on breathing techniques (<code>Pranayama</code>). Maybe the air that we breathe is what we are here to process! Many interpretations of <code>Karm Yoga</code> believe <code>Karma</code> is the minimum set of actions that we must undertake to allow us focus on our breath. </p>
<hr />
<p>Invocation of the primal force, at neural levels, is an invitation to conflicting &quot;thoughts&quot; - to play all their cards. They fight, and they scheme against each other; or in favor of some. They hallucinate in groups and then more subgroups. They leave one sometimes fully vibrant, other times almost dead.  <code>Krishna Dwaipayana</code> was destined to churn thousands of insights from sages (<code>Rishies</code>) - old and new. Most of the time collectively converging onto &quot;truth&quot; but many other times conflicting. He catalogued their wisdom into four foundational spoken volumes - the <code>Vedas</code>. For this legendary work, he was conferred the coveted title in literature - <code>Ved Vyasa</code> (the chief editor of Vedas). </p>
<p>This work, in itself, was virtuous enough to dedicate many lives; though <code>Dwaipayana</code> was just getting started ! He was waiting for a divine<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#divine">7</a></sup> prompt. His purpose was to welcome the full-incarnation<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#8th">8</a></sup> of <code>Vishnu</code>, understand the wisdom 'as is', and preserve it in human mind through one of the most potent narratives ever told - <a href="./bhagvadGita.html">Bhagvad Gita</a> - centerpiece of <code>Mahabharata</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a complimentary gift, to ensure everyone had fair access - anywhere anytime - he ushered humanity from spoken word to the written text - a new experiential universe of narratives. It was like commissioning the hypertext internet of that time. The immensity of his purpose, rightfully so, made him one of the immortal-eights<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#immortals">9</a></sup> in Hindu tradition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to the poetic excellence, <code>Gita</code> conjectured a new way of life - action orientation - <code>Karm Yoga</code> - the method to transmit value beyond the physical laws of nature. The big idea was - actions we do in this virtual world carry forward to continuum with us. And that we instantaneously renew into another immersive narrative (new life) based on the sum total of our accrued <code>Karmik</code> collection. This theme was  central to making <code>Mahabharata</code> more than a narrative. The simplicity of the model - the balanced ledger of <code>Karma</code> - gave the readers a purpose.</p>
<p>It is hard to say if <code>Dwaipayana's</code> work was premeditated, but it sure wasn't an accident. He came from a lineage of scholarly sages. His father <code>Maharishi Parāśara</code> spoke titles such as </p>
<ul>
<li><code>Krishi Parāśara</code> — The science of Agriculture;</li>
<li><code>Vrkayurveda</code> — Insights into Botany;</li>
<li><code>Vishnu Purana</code><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#vishnu">10</a></sup> — Stories of <code>Vishnu</code>; </li>
<li><code>Brihat Parāśara Hora</code> — foundational work on Astrology; </li>
</ul>

<p>How did <code>Dwaipayana</code> manage to write such epic(s) at a time when scribing, in itself, was a challenge? — there was no spell check, no grammar support! In fact, Sanskrit Grammar<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#panini">11</a></sup> was not even formalized yet. And of-course there was no computer. Not even a type-writer!</p>
<p>The legend says, <code>Bramha</code>, in his infinite wisdom, pointed  <code>Dwaipayana</code> to <code>Ganesa</code><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#ganesa">12</a></sup> - <code>Siva's</code><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#siva">13</a></sup> son - the superior intelligence we described in previous chapter. <code>Adi Parva</code>, the first book, details the immensity of this incident in the very first chapter. Here is an excerpt from <code>Kisari Mohan Ganguly's</code> translation -</p>
<div style="padding-left:40px;font-size:0.9em;"> 
<blockquote>
<p>O divine Brahma, by me a poem hath been composed which is greatly respected.  The mystery of the Veda, and what other subjects have been explained by me; </p>

<p>the determination of the nature of decay, fear, disease, existence, and non-existence, a description of creeds and of the various modes of life; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rule for the four castes, and the import of all the <code>Puranas</code>; </p>

<p>all these have been represented. <strong>But, after all, no writer of this work is to be found on earth.</strong></p>
<p><em><code>Brahma</code> said</em> </p>
<p>I esteem thee for thy knowledge of divine mysteries, before the whole body of celebrated <code>Munis</code> distinguished for the sanctity of their lives. </p>
<p>I know thou hast revealed the divine word, even from its first utterance, in the language of truth. </p>
<p>Thou hast called thy present work a poem, wherefore it shall be a poem. </p>
<p>There shall be no poets whose works may equal the descriptions of this poem, </p>
<p><strong>Let <code>Ganesa</code> be thought of, O <code>Muni</code>, for the purpose of writing the poem.</strong></p>

</div>
<p><code>Ganesa</code> was probably the first to comprehend  this irreversible addition.  Being the god of sacred texts , he knew the implications.  Not only did the mode of communication change from &quot;face to face&quot; live conversation to  &quot;offline&quot;, the written word rendered the narrative timeless.</p>

<p>Three-way complementarity - a trifecta leads to physical manifestation. The third represents a unique possibility. One is Unity - truth. Two is duality - information. The third represents all other possibilities of a wave function. When third dimension is frozen, we perceive the artifact as physically manifested. In Quantum Chromo-dynamics, a branch of particle physics, it takes three color charges - Red, Blue and green -  to manifest all the subatomic particles.  <code>Krishna</code> in <code>Bhagvad Gita</code> , described the physical entities (<code>Bhoota</code>) and even the conscious experience of intelligence are <code>Trigunatmak</code> - based on three qualities - <code>Sattva, Rajsa and Tamsa</code>.

<ul>
<li>improvements in the language model to support scribing. For example, there was no concept of punctuation in the &quot;speech only&quot; world -&gt; The written language needed a stronger syntax.</li>
<li>extension of phonemes to capture the true essence of spoken sounds. Cave scribing was mostly pictorial and thus inefficient to convey abstract ideas. <code>Vaidik Sanskrit</code> was expanded to accommodate around <a href="https://oursanskrit.com/sanskrit-grammar-reference/alphabet-2/#:~:text=Our%20mother%20tongue%20(Sanskrit)%20has,sounds%20rises%20to%20around%20eighty.">eighty sounds.</a>  -&gt; Abstraction is key to expanding the &quot;thought&quot;. Thought is the virtual environment of first order.</li>
<li>development of writing apparatus such as palm leaves, ink, and quills. The apparatus must be easy to handle for mass adoption; and the print must last long enough. The simple argument was - if a script didn't last longer than a human life then the effort was pointless - the writer could very well speak the ideas when needed -&gt;  Persistence is a requirement of storage. Storage leads to perpetuity.</li>
<li>triggering a self-sustaining and censor resistant pay back model around scribing. Yes, &quot;scribing&quot; was declared downright demonic ! Many reciters believed wisdom could never be locked in written symbols.

<p><code>Poorna-avatar</code> - The eighth incarnation</p>
<ul>
<li>In <code>Vaidik</code> framework, <code>Vishnu</code> is the manifestative potency of knowledge. It manifests, from the smallest particle to the biggest universe, through it's eightfold basic nature. It is said to attain full invocation of all facets of eight-fold nature in the eighth incarnation. Thus, eighth incarnation <code>Krsna</code> is the full embodiment of knowledge. </li>
<li><code>Krsna</code> is also called <code>Krishna</code> in north India in which case his first name is same as the author of <code>Mahabharata</code> — <code>Krishna Dwaipaiyana</code>. Was it a sweet coincidence or is there something more to it? Many religious historians have described <code>Krsna</code> as many faced God. Their belief is <code>Krsna</code> represents an ideology. Anyone who fully subscribed to its tenets was first-named <code>Krishna</code>. This appears an appropriate deduction for the immensity for roles that <code>Krishna</code> played in the epic and hundreds of other scriptures. For example there is a <code>Krishna</code> who played with <code>Gopies</code> in<code>Braj</code> - one who played magical flute. Then there is one who built <code>Dwarika</code> - a magical town in mid-sea on the coast of <code>Gujaraat</code>. And then we all know of the masterful raconteur who endowed the knowledge to <code>Arjuna</code> - <code>Bhagwat Gita</code> in the middle of the biggest war.</li>
<li>Another sweet coincidence is the unit of measure for gold - a <code>Krishnala</code>. It means related to or instituted by <code>Krishna</code>. A <code>Krishnala</code> was equal to one <code>Ratti</code> of gold, around one tenth of a gram. The popular unit for trading gold was <code>Satamana</code> (= 100 <code>Krishnala</code>), which is equal to modern day <code>Tola</code> (around 11 grams of gold including impurities). In essence <code>Krishna</code> laid down the first unit of measurement as well as currency.</li>
<li>Ninth incarnation (<code>Buddha</code>) is to extend the universe through messages of peace, harmony and equanimity; while tenth incarnation is to move the consciousness into a new universe through machine tools and automation (<code>Kalki</code>)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="immortals"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">9</sup>
<p>Immortal Eight</p>
<ul>
<li>In Hindu scriptures, there are frequent mentions of eight <code>Chiranjeevies</code>. The literal meaning is the one who lives for very long time such that they may be seen as immortals. Amongst them are <code>Ved Vyasa, Parshu Rama, Ashwathama, Vibishana, Krupacharya, Hanumaan, Mahabali and Markandeya</code>.</li>
<li>The idea of immortality is a metaphor for the work they did. For example <code>Parshuram</code> wielded an axe. The axe is a symbol of tools. It is believed that <code>Parshuram</code> is immortal in tools we use to date no matter how sophisticated our machines got from that primordial time. Similarly, <code>Ved Yyasa Dwaipayana</code> is immortal for the literature he created and also the most important tool of the trade - transcription.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="vishnu"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">10</sup>
<p><code>Vishnu Purana</code>…</p>
<ul>
<li>Spoken by <code>Maharishi Parasara</code>, <code>Vishnu Purana</code> (the gem of <code>Puranas</code>) was later scribed into text by his son <code>Krishna Dwaipayana</code>. <code>Purana</code> means ancient stories. <code>Vishnu Purana</code> is thus ancient stories of <code>Vishnu</code> - One of the three primal forces of existence. </li>
<li>In <code>Vaidik</code> framework of Indian mythology, God is not a person. It is a combination of three basic protocols. The protocol that turns knowledge into manifested conscious beings when certain conditions are met, is known as <code>Vishnu</code>. Each of the manifested beings has a separate set of conditions required to manifest. In that, a mosquito is different from a snake. Hence, <code>Vishnu</code> is the collection of templates of creation. </li>
<li>In his idol image, <code>Vishnu</code> is normally shown to bear the universal continuum <code>Chakra</code> on his finger. The incarnations of <code>Vishnu</code>, lead the life to higher state of consciousness. For example, the first incarnation of <code>Vishnu</code>, <code>Matsya Avtara</code> a fish, symbolizes the conscious growth when living beings moved from water to solid earth. His second incarnation was <code>Kurma</code> a turtle depicting the ability of conscious beings to stay and live long on Earth. The ten incarnations of <code>Vishnu</code> are called <code>Dashavataras</code> . They are compared to evolution; <code>Kurma</code> - the amphibian - is regarded as the next stage after <code>Matysa</code>, the fish. Here is the detailed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashavatara">evolutionary interpretation</a>. </li>
<li>The other two primal forces (potencies of knowledge) are <code>Bramha</code> and <code>Siva</code>. It is important to mention that while all three have their respective representations (in idols) in the human form, only <code>Vishnu</code> may physically incarnate in living form. Obviously, because <code>Vishnu</code> is the science of manifestation. It must present reference examples. <code>Bramh</code> and <code>Siva</code> never incarnate in the physical world.</li>

And the flavor of Sanskrit is sure not same as that of <code>Panini</code>.  <code>Dwaipayana's</code> Sanskrit is called <code>Vaidik Sanskrit</code>.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="ganesa"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">12</sup>
<p>The Elephant God</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Ganesa</code> is the deity of intelligence. The legend says that <code>Ma Parvati</code> - wife of <code>Siva</code>, created a humanoid from her skin scrub. <code>Siva</code> unhappy with the limited intelligence of this humanoid (as he couldn't even contextualize that <code>Siva</code> was <code>Parvati's</code> husband), implanted an elephant head on him to invoke superior intelligence. An elephant has three times the number of neurons versus a human brain. </li>
<li>To compare with current largest artificial intelligence systems, a human brain is around 300 times the size of the largest neural networks of our time such as GPT3. Thus, <code>Ganesa</code> has around 1000x natural(not artificial) intelligence versus the largest of our AIs! In a way superior intelligence was put to use in first mega transcription project - from spoken word to written text. It seems like a fun coincidence that we need AIs to harvest the written knowledge in digital realm.</li>
<li>In Hindu tradition, it is considered auspicious to remember <code>Ganesa</code> at the initiation of any major project. He is known to be the biggest problem solver, obviously on account of his superior intelligence.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<div class="footnote-definition" id="siva"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">13</sup>
<p><code>Siva</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Siva is the highest state of consciousness. Evolution of knowledge eventually reaches a state where ‘knowledge’ is absolute. This is the state of knowledge where <code>Vishnu</code> manifests, at the same time it gets a mirror image for observation. The mirror image of manifested <code>Vishnu</code> is <code>Siva</code>. <code>Siva</code> is answer to <code>Vishnu's</code> question - who am I? This potency thus, maintains the systems to support equilibrium of <code>Bramh</code>. In other words, <code>Siva</code> governs the knowledge field. </li>
<li><code>Siva</code> is seen as a potency of discretion that chooses to observe only one (manifested) state of <code>Vishnu</code>, it discards all other possibilities. These three protocols (<code>Bramh</code>, <code>Visnu</code> and <code>Siva</code>) are scale-invariant. They are omnipresent — from a subatomic particle to galaxies and beyond. While all three span the entire universe, only <code>Vishnu</code> is potent enough to incarnate.</li>

<p>With the advent of telegraph, in the early 1900s, the good old typewriter morphed into &quot;teletypes&quot; (ttys) - the visual mode to send text and codes through a wire. Even the news companies such as AP and Reuters used ttys to communicate the stories across the pond. Fast-forward to the early seventies, DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation) adapted the ttys to interact with computers on a commercial scale and an era of massive innovation was unleashed. The tapes and punch cards were still around, and they would stay for long, but the buzz was <strong>DEC's VT100 terminal</strong>. The DEC VT 100  was compatible with their minicomputer <strong>PDP eleven</strong> shipped in 1978.</p>
<ul>
<li>PDP eleven was the first platform on which Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie ported &quot;Unix&quot; in the newly minted &quot;C&quot; language. The development of Unix (and C) had started at Bell labs roughly around four years back on stable <strong>PDP seven</strong> minicomputer (around 1974). </li>
<li>The <strong>DEC VT52</strong>, introduced in 1975, was an earlier video terminal that preceded the more advanced <strong>VT100.</strong> The VT52 had limited capabilities compared to the VT100, but it was still an important step in the development of computer terminals. The PDP-7, when initially used for Unix development, was connected to various types of terminals, including the VT52. This terminal setup provided an interactive and more user-friendly way to interact with the PDP-7 , making the development process more efficient and accessible. </li>
<li>The availability of terminals like the VT52 played a role in shaping the early Unix environment and its user interface. It  had a 24x80 character display, which could show 24 rows and 80 columns of text characters. It featured a keyboard with a standard QWERTY layout. However, its keyboard layout and number of keys were basic compared to later models.  It supported the <strong>ASCII</strong> character set, like the VT100, allowing it to display text and control codes based on the ASCII standard. It could display simple graphics, though it was primarily designed for text-based applications.  Many VT52 terminals featured a parallel printer port for printing output. </li>
<li>The availability of modern keyboards and terminals played a significant role in the development of Unix and the C programming language. Here's how these factors influenced the development:
<ul>
<li><strong>Interactivity and User-Friendly Interfaces:</strong> Unix was designed with the goal of creating an interactive and user-friendly operating system. The availability of terminals with full keyboards made it possible for users and developers to interact with Unix in a more intuitive and efficient way compared to earlier computer systems that relied on punch cards or teletype terminals. This interactivity facilitated the development process.</li>
<li><strong>Portability:</strong> The C programming language, developed alongside Unix, was designed to be highly portable and platform-independent. This was made possible, in part, by the availability of terminals with standardized ASCII keyboards, which allowed for consistent input methods across different computer systems. This contributed to the ease with which C programs could be written and compiled on different machines.</li>
<li><strong>Text Processing and Editing</strong>: Modern keyboards made text processing and code editing more efficient. Unix included powerful text processing tools like ed, ex, and eventually <strong>vi</strong> , which took advantage of the capabilities of modern terminals and keyboards for text manipulation. These tools became integral to the Unix development process.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> The availability of terminals and keyboards allowed for easier collaboration amongst Unix developers. Multiple people could work on Unix and C simultaneously, sharing and editing code on the same system, thanks to the interactive nature of the terminal interface.</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency and Productivity:</strong> Modern keyboards and terminals improved the efficiency and productivity of developers, which was critical in the rapid development of Unix and C. The ability to write, test, and modify code quickly on these systems was a significant advantage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In summary, while modern keyboards and terminals weren't the sole factors behind the success of Unix and C, they certainly played a crucial role in enabling the interactivity, portability, and efficiency that are associated with these technologies. They were part of a broader technological ecosystem that allowed Unix and C to thrive and become foundational elements of modern computing.</li>

<p>AI is still in its early days, and we already see calls for regulation not only from nation states but also from large corporations. No wonder <code>open AI</code> turned closed source :-) Such pressures are going to increase many fold  as we combine AI with next gen automation. It is not hard to imagine independent AI based attempts to improve productivity are barred from existing value exchange systems (fiat currencies). In such a scenario, truly open AIs must have a permission-less, censor resistant and immutable value exchange system. Such a system must be beyond the need of &quot;Trust&quot; in institutions that are anyway trying to establish control. Instead, &quot;Trust&quot; must be based on open code. Bitcoin is such a reference system.</p>
<ul>
<li>as a direct fallout such independent AIs must subscribe to the core philosophy - permission less and censor resistant flow of information. Nostr is a reference implementation of such a model. </li>
<li>Thus, two types of emergent AI systems -&gt;  Ones that are controlled - permissioned and censored. And others that are permission-less and uncensored. In essence the war of ideology transitions from physical to digital universe.</li>
<li>In Vaidik parlance Permission-less and censor resistant stands for &quot;open to all without any controls&quot; and &quot;for benefit of everyone who wanted to participate&quot; - <code>Vasudhaiv Kutumbkum</code> (entire earth is a family). This ideology was termed <code>Sanatana</code> - means one that has no beginning and no end - ever present. The underlying value exchange model of <code>Sanatana</code> is based on  <code>Karma</code> - work for a specific skill. And the measure of <code>Karma</code> is in proof of work - <code>Vikarma</code>. <code>Sanatana</code> believes in immutable divine record of <code>Karma</code>  in universal machine - an immutable ledger of one's actions. The underlying ideology is called <code>Karm Yoga</code>.</li>

<p>Code is an abstraction over our thoughts:-</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple computer program is a narrative that follows a logical story line within constraints of a programming language. We allow certain parameters as variables. Typically, these variables are user inputs. Based on the variables, the thought machine (computer program) comes out with different outputs. In essence, the computer program allows us to visualize different scenarios of a narrative - just the way thought allows us to visualize different scenarios of our physical actions (past or future). </li>
<li>An advanced program such as a video game may take the user into different narratives based on the variable choices.</li>
<li>Computers help us in the sense that the narrative gets fixed and scenarios are different angles of the same narrative. It solves a problem for us that our minds keep changing the narratives and scenarios simultaneously leading to phenomenon called emotions. Emotions take hold when we are unable to analyse all the possible scenarios of all the possible narratives for a given situation - may be because we run short on to compute or time. In the realm of AI , emotions are called hallucinations. </li>
<li><a href="https://robots.net/news/are-ai-models-doomed-to-always-hallucinate/">hallucinations</a> may be mitigated with reinforced learning just the way we can overcome emotional outbursts through practice. Very useful if you try public speaking - first time we hallucinate :-)</li>

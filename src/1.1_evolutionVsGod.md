<center><h1> 1.1</h1></center> 


Just like in a scientific observation, our physical journey has a well defined start and a unique end. The most obvious fact of our life is it has finite duration. We were all born on a specific date . And we will sure die some day. There is no denial to this truth because this phenomenon is under our constant vigil - 24 by 7. Our life is our longest and most meticulous observation. And the good news is we don't need any apparatus of science to observe our life. We all have all the sensors, millions of them , pre built into us to test this particular reality. 

The sad part however is, even our own birth is something that we didn't get to see ourselves. Someone told that I  was born at xyz place on such and such date . May be a birth certificate :-) . We obviously have no reason to not believe the birth certificate,  but at the same time  this quirky fact remains that my own beginning is hidden to me. Even more stranger aspect is we don't know anyone who could describe the experience of their death . We only see others taking birth or leaving their bodies and we assume we must follow the same template.  Even this fundamental observation - the observation of our own life - seems to be incomplete . If that is the case, what chance do I have to understand the start and demise of this universe ? Am I getting ahead of myself ? Before I try to know everything, shouldn't I try to understand the limits or limitations of my ability to understand things ? Wouldn't it be a good idea to sharpen my axe before I get down to cutting the tree ?

You may say that our own birth and death is kind of a unique situation because we didn't have fully developed senses at the time of our birth and in kinda similar fashion, our senses bail out on us when we are experiencing death. And that is the reason we need to believe others. Absolutely true. And that is exactly what I am saying. The reality precedes the inception of our sensory capability and it continues long after . Even if we do crowd sourcing , our collective experience here in this universe is a tiny fraction. All the things that precede our experience, we can only be speculative about them. And all the things that succeed ; we obviously have little to say about them. Don't get me wrong ; we have gotten very good at such speculations but the problem is such speculations (of math and science) are too difficult to wrap our heads around. 

You may also say  why are we discussing our sensory observations in this section :-)  Weren't we supposed to discuss the never ending cycle of this universe - the continuum ? The answer is we need to understand the idea of observation before we attempt to put our arms around the idea of "continuity" or the "perpetuity".  Observation is the key to understanding our sensory reality - and limitations thereof. As shown by Heisenberg in the uncertainty principle, the act of observation, collapses the wave function. In other words, our pseudo reality emerges as soon as we try to observe something. BTW, in our pursuit of understanding the idea of "observations", we will meander many other basic concepts. I humbly request you bear with me during this discussion. At times you may find me going off the tangent but I promise, it will all make sense towards the end. 

Getting back to the uncertainty principle , it gets self evident when we are checking on tiny subatomic particles, but how do we generalize it to our day to day reality - our life ? And again , this is not to say, our pseudo reality is in any way inferior to the underlying true nature. In a way, it is a simplified version to save us from the enormous underlying complexities.  We don't need Godly intelligence to navigate our simplified interface. Let us take a deeper look at the limitations of our observations.

---

## Limitations of Observation 

The first obvious thing is all experimental observations are based on our senses or the extension of senses. As said before, by "extension of senses" I mean all the tools, the machines and the apparatus of science that we use to take the observations. And the second is , observations are always of a finite duration. There is always a start and an end.  The thing about start and end is we can't fully perceive the boundary conditions. From boundary conditions, I mean the split second before the start and same after the end . We are always uncertain as to what led to the conditions where we are starting to observe and what happens after . In our example - we don't know what led to our birth and what happens after we die. 

If we were certain about the immediate past or the future of our observation, then they are also part of our finite observation and then again we don't know what happened before or after - that split second. There is always something before we have complete knowledge of the process and there is always something after we close. We can continue to expand that split second to  say for 13.8 billion years and reach the start of the universe but there is still scope to pre-pone our start . It doesn't really matter if we are talking of our own birth or the birth of this universe , or for that matter any other sensory observation , there is always something more to know - something that created the conditions of our observation . Or something that created (or expanded) our sensory perception itself. 

We now assume that universe expanded in that split second before we have scientific fact of observation . We have a concrete scientific evidence in cosmic background radiations that take us as close to say four hundred thousands years from the big bang . And indirect evidence through gravitational waves might take us down to a pico second - a trillionth of a second close to big bang but there is still a pico second - and a vast unknown before that. That split second is what science believes where this universe became one from zero. Pretty similar to our own birth, the inception of our sensory journey. What we also know as "Survival".

### What is survival ?

If we leave the murkiness before the start aside and the same that exists after the end of the observation, we can attach specificity to these two points. May be with some assumptions. Our senses are designed to take the shortest distance between these two points - the fastest way to consume. In a scientific observation we know this as "accuracy" of the machine.  We want our instruments to take precise measurements as quickly as possible. Faster the better. In normal life we can call this sensory attribute as "survival". Survival of the fittest means the most accurate and fastest way to consume what is available to our senses - food , information and entertainment - everything that we can perceive with our senses.

In other words , this specific start and end is what gives us the illusion of linearity of time - the arrow of time. We can say, linearity of time is a creation of our sensory observations because senses always want to take the shortest distance, the straight line. The underlying nature of time can be say circular or elliptical - we don't know!

---

## Desire

The definitive thing about our sensory perception is we always want to know about that split second. What happened just before the start ? And what is going to happen after the end. And it is quite logical. Let us say we are looking for a needle in a proverbial haystack. The most logical way is to split the stack in two and search first half. If we found the needle, we don't need to search for the rest, else split the rest in the two and repeat the same. If we don't find the needle at all in our stack, we can add little more of the hay from the field and repeat the same operation. In a way we always want to expand our sensory observation till we find what we are looking for. This algorithm of splitting the observable space in two and targeting one at a time is what we know as wave function. Wave is oscillation of our focus in one half and than another . As soon as we find our desired object - our needle , the wave collapses. 

If we don't find what we are looking for , we keep on extending our search space. Next page of google search. Than next and next. It is because of this reason we have already expanded our tiny box from our own lifespan to the lifespan of the universe - 13.8 billion years. Our tiny box is now a big universal box :-) , though we now have more questions than what we started with :-) The quest is endless and so is the supply of proverbial hay. We can expand our search wave as long as we want. Smaller the wave amplitude , more like a straight line it is. 

In a way, wave function collapses as soon as we observe the particle. Or we can say , the particle appears because we are looking for it.

This expansionary nature of our sensory perception is what we know as "desire". Desires are what makes us expand our sensory footprint. We want to have bigger home, bigger and many cars just the way want to know everything in our universe and beyond. Before our universe and after it. It is not that we love bigger home, it is because we didn't find what we were looking for in a smaller apartment :-)

It doesn't really matter if my observations are small like those of a tiny insect or big like us humans , if our focus is expansion - that split second - then we are in pursuit of expansion - the desires. Now our physical survival itself is manifestation of millions of such desires. Desires to breathe, eat , drink and procreate. In a way, we have already made a huge straight line what we know as survival. We have already transformed the underlying true reality. 

Krishna says that we can neither do away this sensory reality nor do we need to. We should rather focus on removing the expansionary nature - that split second - the desires. And after removing the desires , we should regulate the senses to not take the shortcuts. Doing the actions and tasks as they are supposed to be done in this transformed reality. Without cutting the corners to please our senses or not withstanding any external pressures.  We need to follow the cycle the way it is meant to be - Righteous Actions. He says 

> Evam [thus] Pravartitam [ transformed ] Chakram [ cycle] Na [ no] Anuvartaytih [ adapts and practices; follows] Iha [ in this life] Yah [ one who];
>
> Agha-Aayuh [ sinful life] Indriya-aaramo [ seeker of sense gratification] Mogham [ uselessly] Parth [ Arjuna] Sah [ that person] Jeevati [ lives].
>
> Thus , one who doesn't adapts and practices this transformed cycle ; the way it is meant to be. Such a person , full of misconduct and seeker of sensory gratification, lives uselessly. Sensory gratification is in chasing the desires. The expansionary nature of our senses. Or taking the shortcuts on our duties.

So we understood as to how our sensory observations turn the time into a unidirectional arrow. The fastest way to consume and then keep expanding at the edges to keep inflating our tiny box. The question, however, is if time is not a straight line , then what it is ? What is the underlying nature of our reality ? But before we do hat, let us take another look at our tiny box. Our physical and meta-physical systems.

---

## Physical and meta-physical

If we see closely as to what we perceive, there are two types of systems in our sensory reality. The physical systems that we can perceive with our senses - we can touch or feel them; for example the earth as part of the solar system, or even the tiny molecular and atomic particles that we can observe through our extended senses. 

On the other side we have meta-physical systems. These systems are based in some physical system (or a mix of them) but we extend them further. For example a class room is based on physical four walls of a room in our primary school, but a class is lot more than just a room. It is a place for learning , networking and so many more things. We spend most of our lives in these mental constructs. These systems govern most of our sensory observations. Even if we observe, pure physicality, our interpretations (of observations) are invariably in the context of a meta-physical system. Even the scientific observations are with in some community, some society or some project. Unlike the physical systems, the meta-physical systems are highly elastic. We can shrink or expand them based on our desires. Thus desires exist in these meta-physical systems. 

In a way, meta-physical systems transform our reality. This is what Krishna refers to as transformed cycle ..

> Evam [thus] Pravartitam [ transformed ] Chakram [ cycle] 

The key to acting righteously is in knowing the context of these meta-physical systems and see as to how our desires are shrinking or expanding these mental constructs. Sometimes we want to expand our family. Other times we are seeking influence. And so on ..

So we nailed the meta-physical systems. The elastic mental constructs. The problem is these systems are almost impossible to understand with science. Thus we have arts and social sciences to express (not measure)  these systems. However, our real physical systems are easy to comprehend. They are easy for science. May be, we can find a clue of our underlying reality in these physical systems. Lets take a deeper look.

## Our circular physical Reality - the spin.

In our physical systems everything and everyone pulls everything else towards its center. Newton named it Gravity. Gravity is a fundamental force. This constant and impartial pull towards the center, gives everything a circular shape. Or a spherical shape if we want to see it in three dimensional model. Effectively in a large enough physical system, once we reach an equilibrium of some sort everything becomes spherical. We see it in planets , stars , galaxies and even in black holes. We know for sure that central pull exists no matter the size or shape. 

Inherent in this notion (of gravity)is the idea that we are also being pulled by everything else. Towards their center.  The existence of two such forces - inwards ; what we call centripetal force and outwards what we know as centrifugal force (may be due to the rotation) is a hallmark of every observable physical system. Btw we now know that gravity can be inflationary . If the core is made of energy rather than compact matter , gravity is repulsive. And also , the circular or spherical nature of our physical systems is more basic because that is preexisting to our observations of inwards or outwards pull. Two opposite forces exist because there is a continuous spin. 

---
This outwards pull is what gives the stars and planets their orbits or their identity because otherwise they will just fall into the central one. Lighter things revolve or rotate around more more massive things. Thus the notion of a system in which everything is spinning about itself and also rotating around something else. Planets rotate around sun. Sun rotates around a massive black hole at the center of the milky way and who knows milky way is rotating around some super super massive black-hole at the center of the universe. 

There is nothing in this universe that is not circling around itself and around something else .  We know for sure now there are massive black holes at the center of pretty much all the galaxies that make them go round and round. Now in physical systems, we might see some particles or say some meteorites, that don't seem to obey this rule . They seem to be on their path but we know sooner or later they will merge into a planet or a star. Even the photons (light) shall bend around if the gravity is strong enough - say a black hole. 

Even in the meta physical systems - say a class room. A teacher is the central force . In a family mom holds the strings together. In a nation there are governments as the central force and in business there is always a nasty boss looking over our shoulders :-) In a way , the meta physical systems are not that different from the physical systems. They may not appear to have a spherical shape but the very idea that there is a central agency, means they are spherical in nature. If we try to represent a top down model geometrically , we will end up into a circle on a 2 dimensional paper. In essence a circle or a sphere is the most probable configuration of our systems.

## Our Sensory Reality 

Contrasting this obvious circular motion , is the most amazing trick that our  senses play on us. We never feel this circular motion with our senses. I don't feel that I am rotating around the center of earth at say thousand miles per hour. I never see myself rotating around my own axis :-). This clearly means that my experience is boxed into something different from the underlying truth. In a way, I have shaped a pseudo stable reality of meta-physical systems around myself that ignores the fundamental forces of nature. A reality baked in a unidirectional linear timeline of multitude of observations and consequent desires.

Well , you had say that isn't it obvious because the things around us are moving at the same speed. Just like we don't feel the speed inside an aircraft or a train . True, and that is exactly what I am saying. We are designed to feel and appreciate only what is around us . In our vicinity; our tiny box. If we were to know the motion of entire universe, our heads might even explode. Evolution has designed us to focus on a very narrow slice of physical reality. Or we can say we dramatically inflate our immediate vicinity. 

In a meta-physical sense, I am clinging on to a chosen reality that I deem good for my survival and I want to maintain a status quo. Oblivious to the true  nature of the universe, I spend enormous effort to observe what I desire ; instead of what I should do. Clinging to this tiny reality to fulfill my desires vs using it for a purpose is the key difference that Gita highlights as a differentiator between righteous actions and the bondage.

If this is so, the question is what is the purpose of our  linear stable reality ? There must be a good reason for us to chase survival. There does exist a central pull in every system that we can refer to as God but then why do we have autonomy to maintain our identities ? The simple answer is nature is allowing us to build the skills. Skills to serve a purpose. In a way , our immediate reality is our training and testing ground. It is the launch  pad that enables us seek the deeper truth.  In essence God is important because that is the entire system as we refer to as `Bramha` in Gita, but we have autonomy in our immediate reality . And that is what we need to focus on.

---

The more complex answer is that the "Time" as we perceive is what our reality is. Our experience is nothing but time. In a way the stable straight live version of time as perceived by our senses is a simpler version of reality that can be perceived by us mere mortals. Even lesser species such ants and animals can perceive this simplified version of time. Or we can  think of our experience of life,  a very constrained demo version of the full app but this constrained version has the code for unlocking the full version - if we wish to. Again - don't get me wrong. Our version of reality is beautiful , just like iOS :-) The underlying command line based systems are lot more powerful but they are lot more complex too. If you wish to know more about the underlying reality than buckle up :-) 

## Time 

In fact, the very idea of time is generated out of the circular motion we discussed. A day is completion of a circle around the axis of earth. An year is a completion of circle around the sun. The predictable repeatability of events means existence of circle. The very tic tic of the watch symbolizes a circular motion. In fact, in science, the better way to express time is in terms of degrees of rotation. For example in last one hour while you were reading this book , earth rotated fifteen degrees on its axis - 360 degrees of circle in 24 hours means fifteen degrees per hour. The important thing however is that in this one hour, due to motion of millions and billions of stars, everything changed. In fact, every second , everything changes. Thus, time is a measure of change. 

Question is how do we measure the change ? To measure change, we need something stable. A steady frame of reference. And that is what leads us back to the idea of "observation". Observation is nothing but holding on our senses (or extended senses) on an object (or a system)  to measure the change. It always has a distinct start and distinct end. The key difference that our senses create is the focus. We focus our senses on a specific item and we bring specificity to start and end. In a way, our senses provide the stable frame of reference . Thus every observers has a different worldview. And their own arrow of time.

In fact, focus is nothing but holding our senses steady on a single observations. Again and again. Repeatedly , such that the observation becomes a second nature. So intense that observation itself becomes part of our sub-concious. Such a repeated set of actions is what we call skill. If we think about our own body, our own manifestation is amalgamation of thousands of such skills. For example breathing. Millions of cells in our lungs work in unison to accomplish what we know as breathing , the basic block of time. One breath. Yogies can focus on breathing such that their time here becomes timeless. 

In a way, the observation for survival of the physical body is our longest observation. Can there be anything that is even longer than survival ? That is the food for some thought ! And we will address this topic towards the end of this chapter .. 

---

On the other hand if our observations are infinitely small ; means we observe things as they appear and leave them as they disappear; then we should be able to see our circular reality ! Isn't it ? In a way our senses coupled with desires create the illusion of linearity of time but if we remove the desires and start living in the moment than the true nature of time is self evident to us. Stephen Hawking in his best seller "Universe in a Nut Shell" , argues and asks everyone  to devote more attention to understand the concept of "Imaginary Time" . Wick's rotation to an imaginary frame of reference ,  is a well established mathematical concept that when applied to real time, depicts that the time is actually spherical and for our type of universe it needs to be flat on the poles just like the north and south poles of earth.  In essence time and space are pretty similar in a four dimensional space-time model what we call Mikownski Space. 

So we can say that the two extremes are the observation of our own survival - our journey v/s living in a moment. Our own life being our longest observation , that makes the time appear linear and unidirectional and on the other side , the infinitesimally small observation - say living in a moment , that makes the time appear circular. But we don't need to really go to any of these extremes to check the proof of underlying reality. If we observe anything from a distance , without being involved , we see things appear circular. Sun and moon appear circular because we are at a distance. If we stop following politics , even that is a circle - same set of people and parties keep rotating into and out of power. Fashions are circular - same trends of clothes keep repeating every five or six years. Stock market rises and falls. Even the price line of individual tickers take a notch up and then two notches down. If we spread the observations on a longer horizon, trend lines are like a wave. Even our own life is a wave. We sleep and then we wake up. We get hungry almost the same times of the day. Every thing that we can observe dispassionately - appears to be a wave. At the same time, if we attach ourselves to something, it feels like wait is endless. 


## Identity

Thus we can say that desires reshape our reality. This reshaped reality , that seems to have a finite start and end, is our identity. We identify ourselves with the body because that is what we are continuously observing. In addition we identify with friends, family , race , religion , nations , work and so many other things because that is what we are observing. Gita says - this extended identity - `Ahemkara` leads to three other bugs - fear , anger and jealously and together with ego and desires - they create the notion of "Matrix".

So , I guess it is quite clear that we must weed put all the desires if we want to see the underlying true reality. Most religious philosophies and even the common sense would mandate that we cut down our desires and thus action driven by sensory indulgence . Renunciation seems like the best way forward to attain the state of oneness with our true nature. Gita says that this path doesn't work. Instead Gita suggests `Yazna` as the path forward. That brings us to the fundamental question  - What is `Yazna`

---

## Yazna

Let us say you want to research on cellular biology. You want to understand it inside out. I guess you will grow the cells in a lab. May be from stem cells or some other tissue depending on what aspect you wanna study. It is almost impossible to understand cellular mechanism without having a real cell in your lab. And obviously, you need a lab. A lab is a place where you can remove all the external interactions. You can create a focused environment to study the scope you have in your experiment.

Think of `Yazna` as one of such focused environments that we create to figure out the true nature of underlying reality. `Yazna` has many aspects but the core of it is building a skill - doing all the things that you will otherwise do to build a skill in real life but doing so without attachment to worldly expectation. Why ? Because we want to remove all the "desires" from this particular observation. We want to see what happens if we take an elongated observation without the influence of desires. We will talk in great length about the skill building aspect of he `Yazna` in the section on  "Practice and Skills"  ; suffice to say here that Krishna says .. 

> Yajna-arthaat [Done for the sake of Yajna] Karmanah [actions] Anyatra [otherwise] Lokah [world] Ayam [this] Karm-Bandhnah [bondage by work];
>
> Tat [For it] Artham [for the sake] Karm [righteous actions] Kaunteya [O son of Kunti] Mukt-sangh [liberated from the curse of association] Samachara [do dexterously and balanced].

> Things that we do for the sake of `Yazna` - the ritual of actions, are `Karma`. Rest everything is a bondage to the pseudo reality. Thus do your  actions, liberated from the curse of association , external influences `Muktsangah `and with equanimity `Samachara`- looking at the things without any bias. Being `Muktsangah` and `Samachara` are the prerequsites to create a pristine lab - A lab where we want to act without desires. 

In a way , the very definition of `Karma` is the actions that we undertake to accomplish a `Yazna`. I may also add that `Yazna` is just part of `Karm Yoga`. `Karmyoga` includes righteous applications of the skill we build through `Yazna`. In a way, our linear reality is a lab where we can conduct `Yazna` and in addition it also provides us an opportunity to test those skills. 

Coming back to our example of cellular biology. If someone questions as to why are we conducting the experiment in the first place. May be we want to bring out a vaccine . May be we want to solve the mystery of cancer. May be we just want to understand how the cells actually work. The first two are called `Sakaam Yazna`. The last one , where we only crave for the truth is called `Nishkaam Yazna` - A `Yazna` without desires. You may say there is still a desire. A desire to know the truth . And you are right in your assessment. Even `Nishkaam Yazna` has an underlying desire for true knowledge but given that we already have a physical body ; we can't reach a state of `Absolute No desire` unless we know the truth. Thus this last desire is a valid one - the desire to know the our inner self. Our own copy of true knowledge. The true nature of our underlying reality - the continuum ..  Krishna says ..

> Sarva Dharman Parityajya Mam Me Ekam Sharnam Vraza ;
>
> Abandon all varieties of religions , just focus on me. Me being the one whose copy exists in you. Thus just focus on your internal knowledge - your `Atma`.

## Why Skills 

The notion that time is spherical or measure of a rotational change means that history repeats itself though always with a new(er) set of circumstances. Mark Twain once said that history doesn't repeat itself but it rhymes. No matter how long we hold illusion of arrow of time, the underlying shape is circular. Which means we can leverage the skills we develop but each time with a new set of challenges. Thus building skills is a useful exercise. Gita says building the skills is collection of something called `Daivy Sampad` - divine wealth. The  system - `Bramha` can assign you certain tasks only if you have some skills. That is very easy to understand. In our workplace , we get to do specific jobs based on what are our skills. If you are a good coder , you will get to code. If you are a good writer , you will get to write the  documentation :-) . Again, this is not to say one skill is better than other. All the skills are equally important. In the bigger universe, insects breed to clean up the mess, then other species evolve to clean up the insects. Thus evolution is about application of skills based on new set of realities. 

Krishna says , with the skills that we build through `Yazna` , we must participate in the worldly activities. The skills are built not to renounce everything , they are there to implement righteous actions. 

To sum it up and recap , Gita says that our senses are there to provide us a virtual world to hone our skills. Our goal is to develop the skills based on our opportunities in this tiny box. We test and apply these skills in this virtual world but the process of attaining these skills and their application, makes us aware of the underlying cyclic nature of universe - both at physical as well as meta physical levels. In other words, perfecting our game means exit from the game. In that it says that renunciation is good if it is done to focus on your skill building pursuit - Yazna. But renunciation doesn't help if we are trying to run away from our virtual reality - such a renunciation doesn't attract any distinct success. A deep appreciation of our physical reality is paramount to develop the skills and their application. 

Once we develop the skills, and we build innate capability to apply those skills based on new challenges, the assignment of duties gets automated. Thus , evolution automatically assigns us deliverables. We need not chase or worry about what is our righteous goal. Our job is focus on building our capabilities. 

Not only assignment of duties gets automated, even the deliverance comes natural to us as soon as we are ready with our skills. And most importantly, Krishna is there to hold our hands if we falter. We don't feel as if we need to do anything special. The entire process becomes effortless. At this stage we are in unison with the universe. We understand the true reality and we appreciate the beauty of our virtual world. We seek actions and we attain peace. Gita says .. 


> Yah [ one ] Tu [ but ] Atma-ratih [ busy in self ] Eva [ certainly ] Syat [ stays, remains ] Atma-triptah [ satiated  ] Cha [ and ] Manvah [ human ];
>
> Aatmni [ In herself ] Eva [ only ] Santushtah [ satisfied ] Tasya [ for her ] Karyam [ work,, duty ] Na [ does not ] Vidyte [ exists ] .
>
> But one who is busy in herself and stays satiated ; satisfied in herself building the necessary skills, for her there is no feeling of duty . The deliverables and the delivery is automatic. Even building the skills is natural to such a person. 

`Karm Yoga` is the way  to attain this self satiated and satisfied state. 

## Beyond our virtual and physical reality - the unmanifested. 

Now you may say how this all started ? What was there before these physical or meta physical systems came into being. Or what if there is no identity and no control. How do things look like when there are no opposite forces ? It is a difficult question because such a state is beyond our sensory observations. It is even beyond our extended senses. 

Physicists are trying to answer this question for ever. 

I guess we are settled that in our manifested world, both God and Evolution coexist ; God as the core system , as the rules and constants of our physical reality and evolution as our ever evolving pseudo realities; but the question is what was before God or evolution . How did we become One from Zero? One universe held together by a strange force and still evolving at every single level of physical as well as meta-physical. The problem is our scientific models break down at the stage. We can't foresee or perceive what was there before the beginning of time because without the notion of linear time, where do we start the observation and where do we end it ?

Gita says this is a perpetual continuum between observable manifested and unmanifested that is beyond our observations . It has no beginning or end. This too , is in fact a circle. To symbolize this Krishna  bears a circular `Chakra` on his little finger as the only weapon that he needs. In Hindu mythology `Chakra` is the most potent of weapons. Nothing can withstand it. Nothing can destroy it. It also symbolizes that our physical reality is as real as as the unmanifested. There is no reason to think of one as superior to other. 

As we saw, the desires are there to expand our observations. Those 2 seconds before and after. In a way, desires can expand our observations. If the desires are attached to the survival of physical body, we can extend our physical survival. Yogies can live for thousands of years. If our desires are for something else , and we find that our current physical body isn't capable to fulfill those desires, than we have freedom to choose a new physical vessel. Our concious agent can live as long as we need to resolve those desires through many many lives and in different shapes and sizes. We will cover a lot more on this topic when we discuss the concept of "reincarnation" down the line in this book. 

If we look deeper on what exactly is "unmanifested" ; we find that the "unmanifested" is what we are not observing. In a way , if we get rid of desires, and shorten our observations - as in living in a moment , then everything is unmanifested. Does it mean we cease to exist. Answer is no. We still exist in perpetuity and we once again start expanding our stable reality as soon as we encounter a new desire. Thus this is an endless cycle. 

> Na [never]  Tu [but]  Eva [certainly] Ahem [I]  Jatu [at any time]  Na [not]  Asam [exist] Na [nor]  Tvam [you]  Na [nor]  Ime [these]  Jan-Adipah [kings] ;
>
> Na [never] Cha [also]  Eva [certainly- all these] Na [not] Bhavishyamah [shall exist] , Sarve-Vayam [all of us]  Atah-Param [here after] .

If everything is circling about itself and rotating around something central in the physical world, and there is a perpetual cycle from  unmanifested to physical and vice versa; then how do we define freedom or peace? Before we know the path to exit , we need to know what is the meaning of exit, `Nirvana`. We know for sure that natural impulse to manifest is as strong as the impulse to be one with the cosmic if not more. Gita says that the exit from this cycle is in the knowledge of this perpetual cycle. And freedom is in exit from the cycle of desires. We don't need to destroy our beautiful physical reality in pursuit of oneness with the unmanifested. Nor do we need to accelerate the process of manifestation. All we need to do is o allow ourselves attain the perfect balance. And attaining such a  balance is possible only when we truly feel the knowledge inbuilt to us. `Karm Yoga` is the path to this knowledge and it initiates with `Yazna` - A ritual of actions without desires. 

At the same time the knowledge allows us to know that our physical reality is temporary. In essence the knowledge makes us play this circle like a game, without getting attached to it . Thus we can enjoy the motion and attain the lasting peace while performing righteous actions - `Nirvana`.

### What do you believe in ?

Coming back to our conversation on the beginning of universe. Intelligent design or Evolution. Or a continuum between manifested and beyond manifested. The more important point is "Do we believe in something?" . Believing is quite different from the blind faith. If we believe in something , doesn't really matter what  , we are in the same camp. The other camp is who do not believe in anything. If we "believe" we are saying there is a question, and there is "a" or "many" answers out there that need to be found. We can believe in "Evolution" or we can start with "Intelligent Design" ; if we conduct our experiments carefully, and assuming there is only one definition of "Truth" , all believers will reach the same conclusion. Non believers- well they won't even start on the quest till they start believing in something. Thus "believing in" is a pre-requisite for the journey. Krishna says that fastest way exit from the cycles is to believe in ourselves. Our own protected and immutable knowledge because we are what we believe in. 

Krishna puts this idea very eloquently in chapter seventeen of Gita. He says

> Sattvanurupa Sarvasya, Shradha Bhavati Barata; 
>
> Shrddha-mayo yam Purusho, yo yat shraddha sa eva sah.

Means the humans evolve their beliefs according to their nature and nurture. We are believers and we are what we believe in. This also means that we are seekers and we always seek the truth. Which also means that any debate on "my faith being right and yours not" is pretty useless. 

### What we know for sure.. 

We know for sure that things work in unison in this perpetual universe. And most of it[universe] is well automated. The car runs: We only turn the ignition and press the paddle. This is not to say that we do nothing. We continuously expand the decrypted knowledge. Our purpose is to decrypt the knowledge. And the best way to do that is to first understand what we are extending. What is our current immediate reality. 

The simple question that every rational being must ask, how and why all this is made available to us ? Who did it? We can name it an "accident". We can attribute all this to a chance. Or even call it "evolution". Those all are convenient terms to "black box" what we don't know. We can hide the unknown under evolutionary rug, but we just can't deny that we are very lucky to be here. Millions of cards must have fallen in right places. Thus we need to perform our set of actions to help push the boundaries in whatever field we are. The knowledge is not limited to the scientists on the bleeding edge. In fact every single skill is equally important. 

### Quest is eternal 

Long before modern science took current shape, humans asked this question. They asked why the sun shows up ? Why weathers change? We now have better explanations but as Richard Feynman once put it "why" can only be explained to a certain degree subject to the knowledge of asker and the explainer. At some point, after peeling few layers, we find there are infinitely many more layers and any attempt to further explain is counter productive. At some stage, we must accept there is more to it than we can fathom. The spirituals named it "God". The biologists call it evolution, the physicists and mathematicians have yet better name - they call it "probability".

The point here is we can't find the true answer ..Yet.   There is a journey we must complete before we get down to writing the answers. Gita says that journey is `Karm Yoga`.

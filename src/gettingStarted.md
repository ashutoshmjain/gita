The goal of this section is to get an understanding of basic concepts of Gita. To develop a common vocabulary. My attempt is to draw a parallel with scientific concepts because science and math are deeply ingrained into the way we think. 

### Hypothesis 
This chapter describes the ideas of Gita as a list of core principles. Something that we may choose to believe in as it is - as words of the God, or decide to test in our laboratory of our life.

### Continuum
It is a continuation of Hypothesis but the idea of a continuum between knowledge to information and vice-versa needs a deeper deeper understanding of many other concepts. Hence a separate chapter

### Ritual of Actions
The path to `Karm Yoga`. Since `Karm Yoga` is a journey. This chapter describes the four stages to attain `Karm Yoga`.

### Practice and Skills
This chapter focuses on the importance of practice. A daily practice of our righteous actions is known as `Yazna`. `Yazna` leads to `Daivy Sampad` - Divine wealth. This is the first aspect to attaining `Karm Yoga`.

### Manifestation
This chapter describes the world as a meta-verse. How this reality as we perceive shapes up into a perpetual and self sustaining world.

`Krishna Dwaipayana` was destined to compile thousands of sacred insights from sages (`Rishies`) - old and new. He crystallized, then proven wisdom into four foundational volumes — the `Vedas`. For this legendary work, he was conferred the most coveted title in literature — `Ved Vyasa` (the chief editor of Vedas). This work, in itself, was virtuous enough to dedicate many lives; though, his real accomplishment was even bigger! His goal was to welcome the eighth [^8th] incarnation of `Vishnu`, understand wisdom 'as is' from the primal force of manifestation, and preserve it for ever in every human mind through one of the most potent narrative ever written - `Bhagvat Gita`. The immensity of his purpose, rightfully so, made him one of the immortal-eights [^immortals] in Hindu tradition. 

`Dwaipayana's` literary work was no accident. He came from a lineage of scholarly sages. His father `Maharishi Parāśara` spoke titles such as 
- `Brihat Parāśara Hora` — foundational work on Astrology; 
- `Krishi Parāśara` — Agriculture;  
- `Vrkayurveda` — Botany, and 
- `Vishnu Purana`[^vishnu] — Philosophy of manifestation. 

His grand father `Sakti Muni`, was the first to understand `Karmyoga` . And his great grand father `Vasishtha` was titled `Bramhrishi` (The guardian of eternal knowledge). `Dwaipayana's` lineage predetermined his destiny — as if someone planned a multi-generational project to instantiate preservation of knowledge through written words - a quantum jump!

> The difference between humans and any other species is our ability to store knowledge outside the evolutionary mechanism. Animals and plants adjust to changing conditions through slow evolutionary cycles. Humans, on the other hand, may adapt quicker because we store and distribute knowledge primarily through external means. This external storage leads to the notion of a "civilization". A civilization is one that acts around a core rational knowledge base to develop physical and spiritual tools for enhancing the life experience of it's participants - evolution of conciousness. By this definition, a human has much greater conscious experience compared to other species.
>
> The Indus valley civilization was built around  `Vaidik` science , Greco-Romans were founded around work of Homer and thrived around Socrates, Plato, Heraclitus and Aristotle. The rise of Europe was around the Industrial application of science and now America is broadly reaping around the digital wealth of knowledge . The external store of knowledge drives our human world.
>
> The storage was first realized with the "spoken word". Unlike animals, we could remember things told by our parents and they could what was told to them by theirs. Thus precise spoken words - recital, was the basis of first civilization.
>
> The next step up in this ability was the "written word". With written word storage capacity got tremendous boost. It is impossible to determine the exact number of books that have been written to date, as new books are being written and published every day, and many books from the past have been lost or destroyed over time. However, it is estimated that there are over 130 million books in existence as of 2021. Library of Alexandria, built by Ptolemy in early days of the written word ( around 3rd century bc) had anywhere between seventy thousand to seven hundred thousand papyrus rolls. A conversion into a modern textbook size should end up hundred to two hundred thousand books.
>
> And finally, we added next boost to this storage with the digital medium. Internet is still in its infancy, somewhat like Library of Alexandria back in 3rd century bc. As of 2021, there are over 1.83 billion websites on the internet, and this number continues to grow every day. The amount of data stored on the internet is also vast and difficult to quantify, but it is estimated to be in the zettabyte range (1 zettabyte is equivalent to a billion terabytes). Which means, it is already close to  BILLION libraries of Alexandria. 
>
>
> The comparison above is certainly not apple to apple because data on internet contains machine logs, code, graphics and hundreds of other formats but the point really is to show case that in roughly 2500 years, our external storage grew almost a billion times. And this pace is only increasing. As of now we are doubling the internet every two years. In nutshell, we are now reaching a point that the external store of knowledge is bigger than all the living human brains put together. 
>
> Arguments can be made that if someone lived of external knowledge, without ever using their own brains, they will be far superior species than humans. The next stage of evolution is on our doorsteps. As per `Vaidik` framework, every tenth incarnation of `Hari` (`Vishnu`) , leads the way to the next physical universe. Nothing gets destroyed, There is nothing to feel sad about it -  our current physical universe stays as is, just the consciousness moves to a set of new physical rules.

Storage beyond a critical stage creates disruption. Vast storage of water in oceans leads to the atmospheric cycles. Storage of power in batteries (or elsewhere) is the most crucial aspect of stable global grid. Storage of mass in large planets such as earth is the very source of life. Storage of knowledge is the essence of consciousness itself, though knowledge is extremely hard to store. It is a long iterative process of decrypting wisdom, one word at a time.

Not only did `Dwaipayana` edit four Vedas, he compiled eighteen `Puranas` and also wrote the master piece `Jaya` (victory)  — a historical narrative of the early age. History interwoven into thousands of stories meshed up like a knowledge graph. This was probably the first time an epic was "written" at such a scale.

 `Jaya` was later expanded into a mega-epic, `Mahabharata`. With around 1.8 million words, `Mahabharata`, is the longest written poetic collection ever, in any language, old or new. To put it in perspective, it is about ten times the size of Iliad and Odyssey combined. More than the size, the poetry such that it inspired `Kalidasa`, the Shakespeare of Sanskrit . `Abhijnana Shakuntalam` is a rewrite of the plot first conceived by `Dwaipayana` in `Mahabharata`. 

In addition to the poetic excellence,`Mahabharata` defined a new way of life — action orientation (`Karm Yoga`). The epic forms, the cultural basis of one of the oldest civilization — India. It holds within it, center-folded, the gist of four Vedas — `Bhagvat Gita` — the first written source of the idea of `Karma`.

**The question is, how did `Dwaipayana` manage to write such epics at a time when scribing , in itself, was a major challenge? — there was no spell check, no grammar support! In fact, Sanskrit Grammar [^panini] was not even formalized yet. And of-course there was no computer. Not even a type-writer!**

The legend says,` Dwaipayana` invoked `Bramh`to seek scribing assistance. `Bramha`, in his infinite wisdom, pointed  him to `Siva's`[^siva] son `Ganesa`[^ganesa] (the elephant God). `Adi Parva` the first book of `Mahabharata` describes this story in all it's poetic glory. Translated by `Kisari Mohan Ganguly` , here is an excerpt -


> "O divine Brahma, by me a poem hath been composed which is greatly respected.  The mystery of the Veda, and what other subjects have been explained by me;

Having approached by `Dwaipayana`,`Ganesa` — the embodiment of ‘intelligence’, said -  I want to help, but I would stop writing if you paused even for a moment. 

`Ganesa`  probably deemed there was no time to waste, given the immensity of the transcription.  `Dwaipayana` agreed, but he (tactfully) added, `Ganesa` must scribe a verse only after full appreciation of the meaning ! [^humanMind]

>"Ganesa, upon hearing this address, thus answered,

>'I will become the writer of thy work, provided my pen do not for a moment cease writing."

It was the tipping point, when humanity embraced a new medium for the knowledge — text - for both communication and preservation.

---

`Mathura` was the geographic center of `Bharata` — old India. It was also the center of mass adoption of the `written-word`. `Mahabharta` was scribed in eighteen `Parvas` (books). Even if it wasn't a divine "intervention", scribing such an immense scripture at that time, was no less than a divine grace. 

‘Text’ was the new medium. It was somewhat similar to our migration from analog to digital. Not only did it demand new writing skills, it also meant the populations must learn reading, beyond a select class of sages and super sages. We needed mass adoption of computers in early nineties to kick start the digital shift. Superior intelligence `Ganesa` was invoked to usher the humanity into this new era, just the way we are using natural language processing in current digital realm. 

The ‘texting revolution’ was a bigger leap forward (than the digital internet), simply because we are talking thousands of years in the past. The legend says `Mahabharata` got to current state in over six hundred years. It was like the Wikipedia of that time. Every king, every invention of value, must find it's place in `Mahabharata`. 

Any major paradigm shift, necessitates an order of magnitude improvement. There was an all around effort to reduce the cost while increasing the utility. It wasn't that no one knew scribing before, but the written word was pegged to the cave walls. Like murals and wall carvings, text were written on human size posters. Instead of chiseling, they used colors to paint the messages. Paintings and books were of the same measure and medium. An artist could afford to spend an year on a painting, but spending that much effort on a single page of a scripture was hell of an effort. 

In an estimate, a hundred page book, printed on human size frame back then, used to cost a gold [^gold] coin. The goal was to bring the cost down to a silver coin. And bring the size down to a tenth of the human size. An order of magnitude reduction in size, paved the way for large scale adoption of written words. Does it sound like our journey from mainframes to to the smartphone?

What motivations led to this major step-up in our approach to preservation of knowledge? Why would someone take the pains to scribe entire wisdom? And more importantly, how was this wisdom tested before putting into text? 

Following pages are a filtered version of my research investigating that revolution. And not surprisingly, it makes a fascinating story! And also a reflection on why humans keep changing the medium in pursuit to climb the ladder of consciousness! They also answer one question that stayed longer on my mind — Why should any one care for the pen and the paper? What value in spending cycles on the tools of a bygone era! Turned out, our challenges and  moral dilemmas are not very different from that time! The essence of paradigm shift is more or less similar. There is a lot to learn!

For example , as we are moving to increasingly digital world (think VR), we are trying to take books into the new medium - digital copies in similar size and shape as the physical hardcovers! Maybe we are trying to write books on six feet tall poster as our forefathers did when they first tried to democratize knowledge -  a mistake, because the knowledge evolves into a new shape with each evolutionary cycle.  Do we need another way to organize in digital world? Is that new format social media or is it Wikipedia? Or we still need to find a new home for the knowledge — an order of magnitude more efficient than the written media! As we go through the story of creation of `Maha-Bharata`, we will discover many such questions. I can't promise all the answers, but a look at that first shift, might get us a better vantage of our current struggles ..and the road ahead.

Let me rewind you to around seven-ish thousands years back. It is about the time `Dwaipayana's` father was to be born at `Mathura` — a major pilgrim destination now, the foremost seat of learning back then ... and a major mishap occurred — something never heard before — and something that triggered the **writing revolution.**

## reasech and notes:

[^8th]: `Vishnu` - the manifestative potency of supreme knowledge manifests, from smallest particle to the biggest universe, through his eightfold basic nature. Starting from first incarnation, he blossoms till eighth when he attains his full luminosity. Thus eighth incarnation is the only full embodiment of supreme knowledge. Ninth incarnation is to extend the universe while tenth incarnation is to move the consciousness into a new universe.

---

[^immortals]:  In Hindu scriptures, there are frequent mentions of eight `Chiranjeevies`. The literal meaning is the one who lives for very long time such that they may be seen as immortals. Among them are Ved Vyasa, Parshu Rama, Ashwathama, Vibishana, Krupacharya, Hanumaan, Mahabali and Markandeya.

---

[^vishnu]: 
- Spoken by `Maharishi Parasara`, `Vishnu Purana` was later scribed into text by his son `Krishna Dwaipayana`. `Purana` means the ancient stories. `Vishnu Purana` is thus ancient stories of `Vishnu` - One of the three primal forces of existence. In `Vaidik` framework of Indian mythology, God is not a person. It is a combination of three basic protocols. The protocol that turns knowledge into manifested conscious beings when certain conditions are met, is known as `Vishnu`. Each of the manifested being has a separate set of conditions required to manifest. In that, a mosquito is different from a snake. Hence, `Vishnu` is the collection of templates of creation. In his idol image, `Vishnu` is normally shown to bear the universal continuum `Chakra` on his finger. The incarnations of `Vishnu`, lead the life to higher state of consciousness. For example first incarnation of `Vishnu`, `Matsya Avtara` a fish, symbolizes the conscious growth when living beings moved from water to solid earth. His second incarnation was `Kurma` a turtle depicting the ability of conscious beings to stay and live long on Earth. The ten incarnations of `Vishnu` are called `Dashavataras` . They are compared to evolution; Kurma - the amphibian - is regarded the next stage after Matysa, the fish. Here is the detailed [evolutionary interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashavatara). 
- The other two primal forces (potencies of knowledge are `Bramha` and `Siva`. It is important to mention that while all three have their respective representations (in idols) in the human form, only `Vishnu` may physically incarnate in living form. Obviously, because `Vishnu` is the science of manifestation. It must present reference examples. `Bramh` and `Siva` never incarnate in the physical world.

---

[^krsna]: `Krasna` is the full (8th) incarnation of `Vishnu`. Also called `Krishna` in north India in which case his name is same as the author of `Mahabharata` — `Krishna Dwaipaiyana`. In a way `Krsna` is the embodiment of `Krishna Dwaipayna's` knowledge such that only `Vishnu`, in his complete incarnation, could perform this role.

---

[^panini]: `Maha-Bharata` is believed to be before `Panini`, who first standardised the Sanskrit Grammar. `Panini's` grammar — `Ashtadhyayi` has references to `Maha-Bharata` that indicate that it was written much later.  And the flavor of Sanskrit is sure not same as that of `Panini`.  `Dwaipayana's` Sanskrit is called `Vaidik Sanskrit`.

---

[^siva]: Siva is the highest state of consciousness. Evolution of `Vishnu`, eventually reaches a state where ‘knowledge’ is absolute. This potency is thus, maintains the systems to support equilibrium of `Bramh`. In other words, `Siva` governs the knowledge field. `Siva` is thus seen as the one who keeps the knowledge current. These three protocols (`Bramh`, `Visnu` and `Siva`) are scale-invariant. They are omnipresent — from a subatomic particle to galaxies and beyond. While all three span the entire universe, only `Vishnu` is potent enough to incarnate.

---

[^ganesa]: `Ganesa` is the deity of intelligence. The legend says that `Ma Parvati` - wife of `Siva`, created a humanoid from her skin scrub. `Siva` unhappy with the limited intelligence of this humanoid (as he couldn't even contextualize that `Siva` was `Parvati's` husband), implanted an elephant head on him to invoke superior intelligence. An elephant has three times the number of neurons verses a human brain. To compare with current largest artificial intelligence systems, a human brain is around 300 times the size of largest neural networks of our time such as GPT3. Thus `Ganesa` had around 1000x natural(not artificial) intelligence verses the largest of our artificial intelligences! In Hindu tradition, it is considered auspicious to remember `Ganesa` at the initiation of any major project. He is known to be the biggest problem solver, obviously on account of his superior intelligence.

---

[^humanMind]: The idea of the joke is relevant even today. Despite our progress in artificial intelligence, our machines barely understand the human consciousness. For example , a computer may suggest synonyms but it is hard for computer to feel the emotions invoked by the choice of the words. `Dwaipayana` meant that `Ganesa` being a humanoid, could be faster in word processing but he really need to understand the meaning of the words.

---

[^gold]: Barter system was still widespread for the smaller transactions. Commoners used fruits and grains to get what they needed. Rich people used copper as a store of value. A one time adult meal was normally considered one copper coin. So was a ride fare. You could hop on and hop off any boat or cart at any place along its route for one copper coin. Super rich used copper for utensils at their home. For them the valuable was silver. A silver coin was considered same as ten copper coins. One each for every single finger of two hands. Ultra rich ate their food in Silver utensils. For them store of value  was a Gold coin. A Gold coin was equal to ten Silver's. One for every finger of both the hands. The valuation was based on rough order of magnitude in mining these metals. Silver was considered ten times harder than copper, and Gold being an order of magnitude harder than Silver. In a way "proof of work" was baked in universally acceptable currency. All states, no matter what their political equations, honoured this simple "proof of work" based storage of value. Privacy , self custody and universality were the underpin of trading system. Nation states couldn't even imagine to start their own currencies ! Currency was pegged to people's trust in "proof of work". Important point to note here, currency was not pegged to commodities such as iron. Gold, silver and copper were NOT commodities. Gold's only purpose was ornaments , silver was used purely for minting, and copper was primarily used for making utensils for the rich. Copper was supposedly the best metal to store food and water. Eating in silver, though common for rich, was considered a show-off.This simple to understand and time tested system of power of ten, was later exploited by `Aryabhatta` to conceptualize zero and decimal system - the very basis of modern arithmetic.

## Verse 6-1.

Krishna spoke :

 He who unscath'd by craving's fevered breath.

 Doth duty's flower with patient hand unfold.

 Nor clings to fruit that whispers tempting death.

 A Yogi true a Sannyasi bold!

 No hearth's warm glow.

 No outward deed alone.

 But inward fire.

 A spirit keenly sown.

## Verse 6-2.

 For Sannyasa, a name of solemn sound.

 Is Yoga's self, Where fancy's webs are torn.

 No dreamer he, on shifting wishes bound.

 A Yogi wakes when such desires are mourn.

 To quell the heart's unceasing wild unrest.

 This is the mark,  the deeply cherished test.


## Verse 6-3.

 Who seeks Yoga's height.

 Where rapturous peace doth gleam.

 By action's wing must first his soul be borne.

 But when that airy summit like a dream.

 Is reached at last.

 And worldly storms are sworn to silence.

 Then Serenity divine.

 Shall on his spirit, ceaselessly recline.


## Verse 6-4.

 When sense no more a silken thread doth bind.

 Nor deeds entangle in their mystic maze.

 And selfish longings vanish.

 Leaving mind as starlit heaven, 

 On quiet summer days.

 Then Yogarudha,  bathed in purest light.

 Stands firm and free from passion's fading blight.


## Verse 6-5.

 By thine own soul.

 Lift up thy languid gaze.

 Lest in the mire thy spirit lose its worth.

 For self can prove a sun in life's dark haze.

 Or serpent coiling in thy bosom's girth.


## Verse 6-6.

 The self as friend.

 A balm for every smart.

 When by the self the wayward self is tamed.

 But ah.

 To him who fails this crucial art.

 The very self.

 A foe with fury flamed.


## Verse 6-7.

 The conquered soul.

 where gentle quiet dwells.

 In Highest Self a kindred essence spies.

 Through summer's blaze and winter's icy spells.

 Through praise that lifts and scorn that darkly lies.


## Verse 6-8.

 With wisdom's draught his spirit doth refine.

 Unwavering.

 Senses held in soft control.

 To him are kin the shard.

 The golden shine.

 To friend.

 To foe.

 A heart that knows no gall.

 To neutral gaze.

 To hatred's bitter sting.

 To kindly kin.

 Where gentle graces fall.

 Or wrongful hand.

 No varying thoughts take wing.

 The equipoised in heart.

 A vision pure.

 Too much of feasting dulls the spirit's eye.

 And starves the soul of Yoga's mystic bread.

 Alike shall thwart the Yogin's holy gain.

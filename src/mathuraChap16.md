`Pratigya` (abstract noun) means pledge. 

A difficult pledge is `Kathin Pratigya`. A pledge that seems impossible for a human to undertake is called `Bheeshma Pratigya`.

# `Pratigya` ..

It was three months that `Dev` didn't hear from the king. Normally, he used to receive a pigeon every week or max biweekly. The last message he had received was for deploying experts to develop an island far East of the kingdom. There was neither economic, nor any strategic value in investing at that end, but `Dev` knew his father had a vision decades in the future. And in any case, it was not his place to judge the wisdom of the king. 

As soon as `Dev` got the word, he dispatched a group of six superior craftsmen who could execute  this simple work, rather quickly.  Simple in the sense that it was not an engineering challenge — it wasn't like building a dam on a running river — just lodging and a small jetty, and may be few other structures. How would such a settlement be seen as king's legacy — `Dev` wondered! He had an inkling, there must be more to it than what meets the eyes! Over twenty some years of his life, `Dev` had learnt that his father always left a lot unsaid, between the lines. A man less of words, more of deep diplomatic wisdom.

For `Dev`, his father was a role model. While most kings spent their evenings indulging in wine and women, `Shantanu` made sure he spent that time with young `Dev`. Not only did he NOT marry after `Ganga` left, he practiced celibacy to make sure `Dev` got his undivided attention. Now twenty years old, `Dev` understood how hard was it to lead a celibate life particularly when one's evenings were full of opportunities — or distractions , based on how you see sensory pleasures verses focus on the righteous.

King's consistent efforts, and the divine intelligence of his mother, turned `Dev` into finest young man possible. Tall, handsome, strong and energetic — king felt proud whenever he looked at `Dev` and his people saw a natural leader worth following with their hearts. Being measured of his words, `Shantanu` made sure he never let `Dev` feel the extent of his sacrifices. And truth be told, he saw `Dev` as a parting gift of `Ganga` — his only love. To him, spending time with `Dev` was the reminiscences of the past with `Ganga`. He never saw his endearments for `Dev` as a specific favor to his son, though the circle around `Dev` reinforced the relationship as a model 'father-son' relationship. Some of them even cited them as reincarnation of `Dashratha and Rama` from `Ramayana`. The virtuous cycle of affection, once set in, was unstoppable. More son did for his father, more father wanted to do for his son and vice-versa. 

Since the king left, and `Dev` oversaw the complexities of running an empire first-hand, his devotion to his father only increased. The question that recently took over `Dev's` mind was, how would he ever repay his debt? `Rama` went to jungle for fourteen years, to uphold "word" of his father — what would he do? Will he be able to rise if such a situation occurred.

---

Not only did `Dev` deploy his finest crew to the cause, they had blanket permission to ask as much resources as they needed. They must do the best work possible, and of course, they all must take advice from `Maharishi Parashara`. `Dev` had heard great deal about `Maharishi`, though  he never had a chance to see him in person. He had also heard about son of `Maharishi` —  `Dwaipayana`  was supposedly a walking encyclopedia. He had hundreds of scriptures memorized at an age when most students started learning the language. More magical was his capacity to reference different scriptures on a topic, on the fly. Which meant he could contrast different scriptures to ask which was wrong and what was right ! A sure sign that he was growing to be an editor (`Vyasa`). The world still didn't have a clue that not only he would organize the entire knowledge base but also scribe them in written word.

`Maharishi` suggested `Lomaharshana` and `Dwaipayana` be the primary contact for the 'crew from capital', which they gladly agreed. `Dwaipayana` in particular because this was his first assignment outside the walls of `Ashrama`. They quickly set up a camp on the island and mapped out the "would be" settlement. Places earmarked for the lodging, a jetty for porting the boats, fireplaces,  a guest house with high windmill, a high tower and many more. The design of fire-pits was of particular interest to `Maharishi`. He wanted to use them for smoking palm leaves. And yes, there were express instructions to protect all the vegetation as much as possible. No big tree could be uprooted without consent of `Maharishi` — palm trees in particular. Labourers was sourced from the local village. Many `Yogies` volunteered to help in building activities. 

For `Dwaipayana` it was an opportunity to indulge in real life activities and he took deep interest in civil works. More than work, he enjoyed the exposure beyond the boundaries of the `Ashrama`. He realized that the scriptures were grounded in the "actions" of real life. `Nyaan Yogies` got to formulating scriptures after a life long experience in the respective fields. For him it was quite the opposite. He got to work after reading the theory. However, there was a benefit of this approach too ...

The realization, clubbed with his intense memory, made him speak insights extempore. He quickly became the co-ordinator of all planning and review meetings. Craftsmen as well as workers, wanted to listen to his deep insights. They were amazed by the fact that the work that they thought so unique to them, was actually well thought through by many before them.

The work and co-ordination kept him busy though deep with in, he craved for his roots — his 'never known' mother. Why every child had a mother to go to except for him — he wondered —  and why would `Maharishi` stay silent on this topic. The distance in mind was turning into physical distance. He started staying back on the island while `Lomaharshana` needed to commute back to `Ashrama` for his young son `Vaishmpayana` needed his presence in the nights. He was always keen to listen what `Dwaipayana` did in the day. Later he would become the prime disciple of `Dwaipayana` but we are getting ahead of ourselves ..

`Maharishi` could feel that `Dwaipayana` was drifting apart. Is it the adolescence or is it something else? As a keen observer, he could see a new reality taking shape. The unfortunate aggression from `Kansa` turned into an opportunity. He would soon have the palm leaves mass smoked in fire pits, being built by some of the best. The `Ashrama` found a better location. Local people got the work. And `Satyawati` was nearing the next phase of prophesy. He was sure, `Dwaipayana` would soon find his footings. 

The question that still bothered him was how to tell `Dwaipayana` about his mother ? If he let himself be swayed by the emotions, how would he expect `Satyawati` to play her part. As a mother, her affection must be a million times greater than his own !

----

`Satyawati` wondered what happened to the king, and the marriage proposal! Why this sudden disappearance — not even a message! Many times she tried to talk to `Dashraj` who plainly refused to have a conversation on that topic. He was probably hoping that the king would forget `Satyawti` in due course, though something alarmed him inside, that she was special. No man could ever forget even a single encounter with her. 

Many mornings, she waited on the banks hoping to see the king — a futile wait. She did notice a foreign crew started working on the island. Many times she dropped `Loma` and other `Yogies` on the island. A jetty was slowly taking shape. She learnt that the `Ashrama` would probably move to the island. She also noticed many of the villagers started working on the island. They were paid four times the normal wages, and a personal assurance from `Maharishi` to take full care of their families in case anything happened to them on the haunted land.

Days still passed, but nights were difficult. She wondered why she was losing her calm? It was not that she was in some sort of romantic relationship with the king, neither was there any dearth of admirers — her boat was still running full with more passenger waiting than she could accommodate. But something seemed to have fallen apart. On top, she couldn't even go to the island — her only refuge — because  there were people camping out there. What would they think of her if she showed up there alone. Many times she thought of going to `Maharishi` to understand the meaning of this uncertainty but then she remembered what `Maharishi` told her — he could predict future, not the present. What happens in the coming hour, day or even a week is always beyond speculation. It's a roll of dice controlled by our sensory reality. 

One thing she was sure — king would never forget her. And the good thing was this gap helped her assess her own cravings — Is it for the wealth and power,  or did she really see a soulmate in `Shantanu`? He was no ordinary man. She could imagine `Shantanu` in her life the way she could never place `Maharishi` — a partner. Someone to share all your life. She wondered what `Shantanu` was doing at this moment. Was he happy and content? Was the suffering for her alone? 

The most unfortunate thing was she had nothing to act on — only wait for the next hand of `Bhagya`.

With every passing day, `Dev's` worries kept increasing. Finally he sent out a messenger, asking his team at the island to trace the path of the king.  After much inquiries, the crew figured that the king was headed into `Naimisha` forest. A forest known for its ascetics (`Sanyasins`). That was enough to set `Dev` on course to `Naimisha`. After weeks of 'track and trace', he finally met his father. And his eyes watered at the sight as he bowed to touch the feet of his father.. 

King had gotten frail. Grown beard looked old on him. `Dev` understood something was a miss. Few days with the king, he figured that the most important person in the kingdom had lost interest in life. He saw king spending hours in his makeshift tent — sitting alone. Sometimes he would wander into the thick forest in the middle of the night. Other times he wouldn't wake up till afternoon. What is going on? King wanted him to go back to the capital for the kingdom couldn't be left unattended, but `Dev` knew he must attend to the king. 

One evening, he was hanging out with king's closest guard - One that had gone to fetch `Dashraj`. In the conversation it came out that this sudden change in king's lifestyle was after the king met `Dashraj`. No one had any idea, why king met `Dashraj` and what transpired between two of them. Asking king was inappropriate  because if he didn't tell it his closest yet, maybe he didn't want to bring this topic. 

The only source of information thus was `Dashraj`...

----

Taking an assurance for a daily communication, `Dev` took leave from the king . King was satisfied that `Dev` prioritised responsibility to the kingdom above his personal distractions. He asked `Dev` to promise he will always dedicate his life to the cause of the kingdom more than anything else. Which he did till his last breath, but he did have one more action to complete on his way back to the capital — he wanted to  meet `Dashraj`. What kind of black magic this erst-while `Asura lord` played on the king. What exactly did he tell the king that made him lose interest in life. His initial hunch was `Dashraj` must have brokered the deal between `Shantanu` and `Kansa`, for the idea that king was love struck, was beyond his wildest imagination. He also wanted to personally check that the work was meeting `Maharishi's` expectations. And of-course, he was curious to see `Dwaipayana`. His crew had reported the anchor role a ten year old was playing on this project.

When it came to relationship with neighboring states, `Dev` practiced his father's philosophy. Just like `Shantanu` he had his men set up the camp a mile before `Yamuna`, to avoid unnecessary talk. To keep it easy and to save time, he sent his men to buy few boats so that they didn't have to depend on public transport, or conceal their identity. He and one of his closest ally (and chariot driver) - `Rituraj`, crossed the river at first light. He sent `Rituraj` to get `Dashraj`, while he himself, went straight to the `Ashrama` to meet with `Maharishi`.


`Lomaharshna` was about to leave for the island when he saw a princely man of his age stepping into the `Ashrama`. His body armour and confident walk, were his introduction. With folded hands `Loma` welcomed the prince and took him to `Maharishi`. As he touched `Maharishi's` feet — `Chirayu Bhav` (live a very long life — were the words that came to `Maharishi` lips. A sense of pride came over `Maharishi` when he properly saw the young  man — your father is very rightly so proud of you! And I pay my respect to the mother who gave this kingdom a leader like you. — said `Maharishi` — What brought you here `Vats` (an affectionate way to address youngsters).

Walking towards `Maharishi's` hut, `Dev` said with folded hands — `Maharishi` , I wanted to check if the work on the island is going to your satisfaction. `Maharishi` was pleased at the gesture though he knew a prince wouldn't leave the kingdom just to get a progress report. There must be something else. He smiled — `Vats`, I am very happy with the craftsmen you sent. `Loma` here and `Dwaipayana` are coordinating the work. — he pointed towards `Loma` —  And I hear them pleased with the quality and dedication your team brought to us. Stepping into the hut, `Maharishi` asked `Loma` to bring `Dwaipayana` over from island, while prince takes some food and rest. It's been few weeks that `Dwaipayana` was living on the island, and  `Maharishi` himself wanted to see his son.

`Loma` had just stepped outside (second time) the `Ashrama` when he saw `Rituraj`, who inquired about the prince. Good lord — `Loma` thought to himself — looks like today I will miss all the boats. He smiled on the fate as he repeated to himself what `Maharishi` always said — the events in the "present" are beyond anyone's control. Both of them introduced themselves to each other while walking towards `Maharishi's` hut. `Rituraj` sought blessings from `Maharishi` and sought permission to say a word to the prince. Seeing `Maharishi` nod, `Rituraj` whispered to the prince — looks like `Dashraj` has gone to the island. He is trying to get a bigger piece of work in search of a bigger pie for himself and other `Asuras`. 

Turning to `Maharishi`, prince, sought permission to say few words. Seeing `Maharishi` nod, he said — `Taat` I would love to spend time in the `Ashrama` but I wanted to visit the island to see for myself the progress of the work. If you don't mind, we could accompany `Loma` to the island. That will allow us to speak with `Dwaipayana` on site.

`Maharishi` smiled. Probably he wouldn't get to see `Dwaipayana` even today. Raising his hand, he said — Of course. I wish I could come with you too but I need to run this `Ashrama` — turning towards `Loma`, he added — you are in good hands. 

All three of them headed towards their private boat after seeking another round of blessings from `Maharishi`. `Loma` once again didn't fail to notice his fate. He was worried about missing the boat and god sent a private boat for him !

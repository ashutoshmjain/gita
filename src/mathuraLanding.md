# A `Writing` Revolution

`Mathura` was the geographic center of `Bharata` — old India. It was also the center of mass adoption of `written-word`, to prevserve and pass on knowledge.


`Maha-Bharata` was the first major narrative written down in text. Even if it was a human endeavor, scribing such an immense scripture at that time, was no less than a divine grace. ` Krishna Dwiapayana`, the author of the epic,  made a crucial point in the very first book `Adi Parva` — narrating a scripture this complex to the masses, was almost impossible unless it was scribed in a book format . In a way, it was the tipping point, when humanity adopted a new medium for communication, and preserving the knowledge.

## It all happened in `Mathura`

Let me rewind you to around seven-ish thousands years back. It is about the time  `Dwaipayana` 's father was to be born at `Mathura`  — a major pilgrim destination now but the foremost seat of learning back then ... and a major mishap occurred — something never heard before — a trigger for writing revolution.

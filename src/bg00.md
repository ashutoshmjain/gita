The purpose of converting **Bhagavad-gītā** into English poetry, albeit through AI, was to make its profound teachings more accessible, engaging, and emotionally resonant to a wider English-speaking audience, particularly the next generation. Gita is immutable, but the metaphors used to explain dense topics need to be time- and place-specific. That is where tools like Gemini Deep Search and NotebookLM come in handy. 

The audio quality and diction of NotebookLM is extraordinary. It is like a superior intelligence learning and rendering an epic from superior intelligence (Vyasa and Ganesa). That said, everyone sees their own reflection in Gita. It is a poem written such that the meaning is always complementary to the inner state of every single listener. Thus it is perfectly all right to ignore what you hear in these episodes, and let your own imagination take over!

The original Sanskrit verses were sourced from [SanskritDocuments.org](https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_giitaa/bhagvadnew.html). The show is available through any podcasting app that supports [Podcast Index 2.0](https://podcastindex.org/podcast/7267041)

For the best listening experience, please visit chapter pages by clicking the menu icon in the top left <i class="fa fa-fw fa-bars"></i>. There, you can listen to the Spotify feed while reading the verses.

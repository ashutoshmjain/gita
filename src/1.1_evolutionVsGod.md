Over last few decades, the debate about science v/s religion has reduced to "Evolution v/s Intelligent Design". The primary evolutionary argument is that things didn't begin with a pre-decided grand design but over millions of years , the natural selection forced the survival of the "fittest", that led to the world we have. On the other hand religion has become synonymous to the idea that someone external - say God, created this entire walled garden in which we roam around . The argument on this side is normally that the beauty and complexity of this magnitude can't be a mere accident. 

The debate can further be reduced to a simple idea 

>> Did system create the modules or modules create the system. 

Let me break this down a little bit more .. 

## Intelligent Design Vs Evolution 

The system stands for the preexisting intelligence - say God. If the system consciously create the modules that it runs on, we call it "Intelligent Design". If the modules preexisted the system and voluntarily came together to ensure survival than it is an evolutionary impulse.

Each module can then be considered a system in itself. And the same pattern can be applied. The system itself can be considered a module of still larger system. Thus we can break this down to cellular level and scale it up at the level of planets , solar systems, galaxies or even universes. 

In other words - this is a classic "Chicken v/s Egg" debate. Who came first. Or we can say that we are trying to decipher if the things work top down or bottom up ? An intelligent system being a top down system and an evolutionary system being the bottom up one. 

## What happens in normal world

The question really applies to the extreme conditions - In this case it is the beginning of universe. Or beginning of life. Or beginning of any system. In normal world, both these things go hand in hand. Top down as well as bottom up. There is always an impetus to kick-start something then let it evolve over a period of time. For example if we look at an operating system  say Linux , it is easy to see that it evolved from Unix. We can say that it was for survival. The other commercial systems such as Windows were taking over the personal computing space , so Unix had to adapt itself into a system that runs on Intel Chips. Starting with a humble beginning, today Linux has 27 million lines of code. Over last thirty years, it has matured as one of the finest operating system that evolved not only as a server system but made huge inroads into mobile space (Android) . Seems evolutionary. Isn't it ?  But then we know there is Mr. Linus Torvalds, along with tens of thousands of open source developers, who continuously watch it grow , improve it and manage it . Their mind and intelligence and perseverance is what Linux is. Seems like an Intelligent Design to me. 

We can expand this example to our kids. They grow, evolve and become something very different than us - evolution. But then we are always there watching them, helping them - Intelligent Design.

Thus we can conclude - under normal conditions, both evolution and intelligent design are at play. Hand in hand. 

So the question now becomes

> Did system create the modules or modules create the system at the beginning of this universe ? We are talking about the boundary conditions. 

Now this is the question that all the physicists are trying to answer. The laws of physics breaks down at the singularities. There is kind of cosmic censorship on what could be revealed to us - the mere mortals. The point is No one knows what happened at the beginning. There are speculations. Some have a mathematical bend. Others have a spiritual connotation. 

## Are we capable of addressing this question ?

We can argue [inconclusively] but what is  the point? The goal is not to get into "chicken or egg " debate because that doesn't solve any question. Inconclusively , because we can not answer this question till we know all the answers. Thus the idea is to first understand what is currently going on - as of this very moment. If we don't understand the present, what is our chance to successfully speculate about extreme past - the beginning of the universe. 

We don't even know the exact nature of time. Then it is obviously beyond us to know about past. In fact there is a [paper](https://phys.org/news/2011-04-scientists-spacetime-dimension.html) at phys.org that says time itself is a misnomer. It claims  there are only four spatial dimensions in what we call Minkowski  space. It claims that the clicking of watch is merely an observational construct that we have developed to measure things in Euclidean space. Where is works fine. But as soon as we enter the realm of special theory of relativity for observations at far flung distances, the notion of time becomes a drag to explain the reality.  Instead a four spatial dimensions model is a much better choice. 

Btw, it is well established that time is not a fundamental property such as mass, charge or even temperature. And time, as we know it, the clickiking of the watch, is only a numerical order. However the numerical order does give us our universe a strange property of memory. We are built on he basis of our histories. The knowledge seems to lie in the history but it is about the order of things not the time stamps. Now the order need not be linear. It can follow any other shape - for example circular or spherical. 

## What does Gita say ?

Krishna is really intelligent. He knew this question will come and waste time. So he said this universe has no beginning or end. It is in fact a circle. To symbolize this he bears a circular `Chakra` on his little finger as the only weapon that he needs. In Hindu mythology `Chakra` is the most potent of weapons. Nothing can withstand it. Nothing can destroy it. That is what our reality is. Its a circle that has no beginning ; no end. In fact Stephen Hawking, in his best seller `Universe in Nutshell`, argues and asks everyone  to devote more time to understand the concept of "Imaginary Time" . Imaginary time is a mathematical concept that when applied to real time, depicts that the time is actually spherical and for our type of universe it needs to be flat on the poles just like the north and south poles of earth. The details of imaginary time are beyond the scope of this article but I highly recommend (as recommended by Mr Hawking himself) to explore the nature of time. 

In this circular time line - things manifest based on Karma. Each conscious agent has full control on the 'Karma` but we act based on what we believe in - means faith. 

## Faith is a pre-requisite.

The more important point is "Do we believe in something?" . If yes, we are in the same camp. The other camp is who do not believe in anything. If we "believe" we are saying there is a question, and there is "a"  or "many" answers out there that need to be found. We can believe in "Evolution" or we can start with "Intelligent Design" ; if we conduct our experiments carefully, and assuming there is only one definition of "Truth" , all believers will reach the same conclusion. Non believers- well they won't even start on the quest till they start believing in something. Thus "faith" is a pre-requisite for the journey. It doesn't matter where it lies. 

Krishna puts this idea very eloquently in chapter seventeen of Gita. He says

> Sattvanurupa Sarvasya, Shradha Bhavati Barata; 
>
> Shrddha-mayo yam Purusho, yo yat shraddha sa eva sah.

Means the humans evolve their faith according to their nature and nurture. We are believers and we are what we believe in. This also means that we are seekers and we always seek the truth. Which also means that any debate on "my faith being right and yours not" is pretty useless. 

## What we know for sure.. 

We know for sure that things work in unison in this perpetual universe. And most of it[universe] is well automated. The car runs: We only turn the ignition and press the paddle. This is not to say that we do nothing. We continuously expand the decrypted knowledge. Our purpose is to decrypt the knowledge. And the best way to do that is to first understand what we are extending. What is our current immediate reality. 

The simple question that every rational being must ask, how and why all this is made available to us ? Who did it? We can name it an "accident". We can attribute all this to a chance. Or even call it "evolution". Those all are convenient terms to "black box" what we don't know. We can hide the unknown under evolutionary rug, but we just can't deny that we are very lucky to be here. Millions of cards must have fallen in right places. Thus we need to perform our set of actions to help push the boundaries in whatever field we are. The knoelwdge is not limited to the scientists on thebleeding edge. In fact every single skill is equally important. 

## Quest is eternal 

Long before modern science took current shape, humans asked this question. They asked why the sun shows up ? Why weathers change? We now have better explanations but as Richard Feynman once put it "why" can only be explained to a certain degree subject to the knowledge of asker and the explainer. At some point, after peeling few layers, we find there are infinitely many more layers and any attempt to further explain is counter productive. At some stage, we must accept there is more to it than we can fathom. The spirituals named it "God". The biologists call it evolution, the physicists and mathematicians have yet better name - they call it "probability".


The point here is we can't find the true answer ..Yet.   There is a journey we must complete before we get down to writing the answers. Gita says that journey is `Karm Yoga`.

<center><h1> Chapter 1.0</h1></center> 

Gita proposes a simple hypothesis to explain the nature of this "reality";  and a framework to exit the maze. It is not wrong to call it a maze because we barely understand how this all works. It looks similar at sub-atomic level as it seems at the astronomical scales. In fact , the sub atomic level has turned really crazy. We now have a God particle! We can't predicate as to what transpired at the beginning and what does the end look like!  Hard problems of science aside, we have little handle on our own body and mind. Despite all the material consumption, we are emotionally drained - evident in our substance abuse and suicide rate. An average American family spends more on meds than on food. Despite all this, it feels so natural that we are rarely bothered to understand where we are. Its not like we are lost in a jungle and are desperately looking for the ways out. If at all any, our efforts are to perpetuate this maze. While we keep on surviving from accident to another , from one generation to the next , our quest seems to be eternal though we barely understand what we are looking for ! That seems to be the biggest paradox that we are continuously searching for something unknown !

The Gita Framework resolves many of our burning questions, or at least attempts to set priorities for our strife. The later is more important because even science appears to be all over the place ; least said about the degradation of religions. In a way Gita, gives necessary structure and skeleton to our quest - scientific and spiritual. And it gets more relevant in these asking times, when on one side imminent  opportunities (think artificial intelligence, robotics , space and biotech) are hitting exponential trajectory, and on the other more than half the humanity struggles for elemental air and water. There was never a bigger demand on humans to choose right from wrong and then stay focused on path. 

## The Hypothesis

Gita  proposes a distributed model of knowledge. Distributed computing is fairly common these days thanks to  "Block Chains" and crypto currencies. It says a full copy of  [protected] knowledge `Atma` is pre-built into all of us. We being the conscious agents `Jeeva` . Protected because, this "knowledge" can not be destroyed by "worldly" means. Metaphorically - Fire can't burn it. It can't be drowned in water. Krishna says ..

> Na [not] Enam [this] Chindanti [cut through, make a hole --> destroy] Shastrani [weaponry] ; Na [not] Dahati [burns] Pavkah [fire].
>
> Na [not] Cha [ and] Enam [ this] Kladyanti [moistens] Aapah [water] ; Na [not] Shoshyati [dries] Marutah [ fast air] .
>
>  Weapons can't cut through or make a hole in it. Fire can't burn it. Water can't moisten it and air can't dry it. Which basically means it is not in the realm of manifested. 

Krishna further says that the physical body is fungible but if we let lose this beautiful apparatus without decrypting the knowledge,  that is a wasted opportunity.

The "know how" to harness the energy is implicit in this knowledge. Thus a worldly metaphor would be a combination of DNA and Electricity - DNA as a representation of information and electricity to symbolize energy . In a way, this knowledge is the quantum field where the conscious particles take birth,  but Gita says that this can't be perceived by our normal senses. In a way it is encrypted `Avykta` to our externally focused mind and body. BTW, this is not a call for the blind faith. Just as in any scientific inquiry, we start with a hypothesis and then test the validity through experiments , we will see down the line in this book as to why this knowledge is encrypted and how to perceive it without using the survival oriented senses. Or learn to focus our senses on `Atma`. 

Since all of us get a full copy of this knowledge and the energy to act, we are free to choose our actions. Our Actions `Karma` determine what we finally shape into from our physical body standpoint and what we manifest in the world. We have full control on our `Karma`. 

## Worth knowing and Knowable. 

Gita says, this [protected] knowledge is all we need to know . 

Worth knowing because the answers to all the questions that we are seeking outside, are already embedded with in us. In a way the biggest question is who we are ?  That is what we are searching when we climb the `Himalayas` or sink to the depths of ocean or venture into deep and dark space. Our quest is to find who we are of is there something else, someone like us ?

Knowable because it is  built into us, it is called `Atma` which literally means "Me". In essence, this knowledge is what we are. Even if we identify ourselves with the body ; our Physical body (and mind) are only  tools to enable the "Actions". Like all other tools, they too decay with time. We sure need to take care of the tools but that care is meaningful only if we know who we are. 

> The good news is it is "Knowable". The bad one is it appears encrypted to our externally focussed senses. BTW it is important to state the meaning of "encrypted". Encrypted doesn't mean "impossible". It only means that it is hard to decrypt unless we devise a better algorithm. Better ways and means to understand the problem. This algorithm, the experiment and the set up is what we call `Karm Yoga`

Just as a Black hole, though beyond our sensory observatories, because information can't travel back from them , we can affirm their existence and other properties such as mass, rotation and entropy , through what they do.  Their effects. The best way to approach this inner knowledge is to observe the "Actions" it drives. The process of getting attached to (or focusing back on) the "Actions" is called `Karm Yoga`.

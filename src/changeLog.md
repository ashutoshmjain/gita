# changeLog

Since this is a living book, a weekly update is released with the list of major changes here-below. Readers can sure check the changes with `git diff` on github but it is kinda messy, and hard for the those with limited exposure of version control systems. Thus this changeLog â€” with links to the pages that I updated in last week , is the easiest way for the readers who are interested in the live changes on (weekly basis).

## research and notes:
[^edits]:  "general edits" means I reviewed the full page and made changes to the text and flow. These could be small changes , additions of few lines or rearranging the text for better readability.

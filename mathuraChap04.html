<p>The all important question — if (or not), there exists one unique righteous path? — what is the true definition of <code>Dharma</code>? - was a matter of regular discussion that ran deep in the family. <code>Vaśiṣṭha</code>, thought there were many paths for one to realize her worth. He believed in power to the people. He felt a farmer was as important as a priest and so was a cobbler. And one may alter the path of her choosing - as many and any time. As a pragmatist, <code>Vaśiṣṭha</code> wished peace to everyone no matter what choices they made. The reason he had much influence among the seven <code>Bramhrishies</code> was his unique blend of knowledge with humility. He defined <code>Dharma</code> as a vigil appreciation of existing reality; and timely adaptation to the change. That said, he never changed his own course!</p>
<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line -->
<div style="padding-left:40px;font-size:0.9em;">
<p>It is important to understand <code>Dharma</code> as opposed to popular translation - religion. <code>Dharma</code> is rendering one's duties - without desires. Desire is an impulse to alter the reality. <code>Dharma</code> is a set of methods to find contentment whatever be the situation. If you were happy in current situation, why would you want to change? That, however, doesn't mean situation wouldn't change - they do all the time. Since the situations are always changing, <code>Dharma</code> is a dynamic role play. Religion, on the other hand, is fixated (blindly) either to the preservation of old values, or a painful persuasion of the new - towards a desired outcome.</p>
<p>Righteous is simply rendering one's duties as expected by the current reality, and a curious welcome to ensuing change. For example, trees don't resist the weather. They shed their leaves or grow the new ones. Water flows no matter how convoluted river course. Such abject surrender, with equal enthusiasm for change, removing self from the picture, is <code>Dharma</code>.</p>
</div>
<p><code>Śakti Muni</code> added a new perspective to his father's approach. He redefined <code>Dharma</code>. He argued - a righteous person, must stick to one path. If someone stayed flexible, how they were any different from animals! And how would they accomplish excellence? <code>Śakti Muni</code> rehashed <code>Karm Yoga</code> as full commitment to one's chosen path. He probably didn't realize this little change would lead to an upheaval.</p>
<p><code>Karm Yoga</code> as an idea, was slightly different from the <code>Nyaan</code> and <code>Naad Yoga</code>. The purpose here was still to indulge in repetitive actions, but the knowledge thus gained was a mere by-product. Quite the opposite to the approach of <code>Nyaan Yoga</code> wherein the goal was to accomplish better utility with lesser effort - to find the most efficient way to cultivate, transport or the metal works. And unlike <code>Naad Yoga</code>, <code>Śakti's</code> method didn't seek ascetic behaviour. It didn't promote someone conducting <code>Dravya Yazna</code> as an intermediary between humans and their deities. In that sense, it appeared easier to practice - a sustainable path for ordinary people. All it needed was to perfect one specific skill and keep on doing it - like a machine. In a way, he was the first to underscore specialization - an industrial approach to society.</p>
<p>True to his name, <code>Śakti's</code> ideas were powerful. The word <code>Śakti</code> literally means power. However, ascertaining a righteous path is easier said than done. Every time we focus on one task - the task splits into multiple skills - like the branches of a tree. The definitions get nuanced as soon as we peel the first layer. Every human views the reality differently owing to their <code>Sanskaras</code> - the core orientations. Even the meaning of words are perceived differently based on the narrative we subscribe to. Above all, humans justify their actions as righteous, because they deem their situation unique - sometimes unaware that such claims were rooted deep into desires.</p>
<p>The big question for an individual thus continued to be - what is the righteous path ? The answer demanded rigorous personal discovery - &quot;who am I ?&quot;</p>
<h2 id="41"><a class="header" href="#41">4.1</a></h2>
<p><code>Śakti Muni</code> practiced what he preached, and he ended up sacrificing his life for the sake of his beliefs. That fateful winter morning, he was en-route to the river with rest of the congregation — for the morning dip in <code>Yamuna</code> — a daily routine <code>Vaśiṣṭhas</code> had instilled over many generations. With time, it had shaped into a daily procession - commoners would line up the sides to see their role models - to seek their blessings. A tradition still practiced in many parts of India. The first dip used to be reserved for <code>Bramhrishi</code>, but this morning, he didn't join - winter was taking a toll on aging saint. <code>Śakti's</code> wife too excused herself due to morning sickness - a common condition in early pregnancy. A mother has a sixth sense to protect her unborn - she probably sensed the bad omen!</p>
<p>That cold ominous morning, a self-proclaimed tribal king <code>Kalmashapada</code> happened to be on same path - returning from <code>Yamuna</code> -  with his queen and chosen savages — drunk and sleep-deprived. Apparently they had spent the night on the banks, hunting the innocent animals - roasting them alive to eat with local hooch. The shrieks of scared animals were audible to <code>Śakti Muni</code> in the silent night, though his cottage was quite a distance. In the morning he also got the news - that king's men had taken women from the nearby village - with force. And kept them awake whole night — doing whatever they felt right to please themselves, and their <code>Rakshsa</code> lords. </p>
<p>In the rush hour, <code>Śakti Muni</code> expected <code>Kalmashapada</code> to clear the way. The scripture mandated right of path to a sage. On the other side - the king, oblivious to <code>Śakti's</code> ideology - expected a clear path for himself - particularly for his new queen. He had expected the sage would shower blessings on their new union. In fact, he had hoped <code>Śakti Muni</code> would show up the last night - to welcome them on this side of <code>Yamuna</code> - with proper rituals ! Yes - there used to a ritual to welcome the kings in your village or city. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rumors said the discussion turned into an altercation. Out of anger, <code>Śakti Muni</code> cursed the king and his troupes to turn into monsters - instantly - for the monstrosity they spread on the peaceful range. That did happen but the king, having turned into a monster, killed <code>Śakti Muni</code> and his team. That is what monsters do.</p>
<p>Stories being symbolic, they gloss over the details. <code>Śakti Muni</code> must have questioned the savages for their abhorrent behavior. The righteous duty of a saint leader is to confront the injustice. And the king was anyway a monster!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The news spread like a wildfire. Some saw it at the face-value - a sudden rush of blood that went off the handle. Others saw a deeper message of stars being misaligned. Many thought, it was a bigger conspiracy. Yes, conspiracy theorists existed even back then! One version claimed <code>Kalmashapada</code> was instigated by <code>Vishwamitra</code> - another saint of the same stature as <code>Vaśiṣṭha</code> - one of the seven <code>Bramhrishies</code>. No one knows the truth though <code>Parāśara</code> is said to have acknowledged this later in <code>Vishnu Purana</code>. </p>
<p>As many versions, as many mouths! Truth besides, for most it was a time-pass gossip. It continued long after the incident. The conversations of impending doom are naturally sticky. Some of them attributed the mishap to humans trying to be gods. Organized agriculture, burning ore in fire pits, and attempts to tame the winds were clearly not meant for the humans! The idea that bad times are inevitable, makes the best of sensationalism, but for <code>Parāśara</code> it was personal. </p>
<p>Young <code>Parāśara</code> grew in the shadows of this gut-ranching chatter. Such conversations had a traumatic bearing on his child mind. And more so, because he had a gifted imagination. For one, he internalized a deep hatred for the <code>Rakshsas</code>, but more importantly he questioned if (or not) one must stick to one's path? Is there a subset of traits (<code>Vritties</code>) that must be followed by every human - a core set of values - no matter what path they were on. As a youth, he wondered what was that ultimate wisdom? </p>
<p>The question that laid heavy on his mind and kinda morphed into a lifelong quest was to formulate that value system. This is probably where the word &quot;righteous&quot; got added to notion of <code>Karma</code> --&gt; practicing any action was not <code>Karm Yoga</code> - he thought - the actions must be righteous. But then how to define the righteous actions because situations may change unexpectedly. And who gets to determine worth of actions? Who is the final arbiter? Killing someone was obviously bad, but it turns righteous in a war. And what if the war was to revenge his own clan - a challenge <code>Parāśara</code> must engage in to clear his soul. </p>
<h2 id="42"><a class="header" href="#42">4.2</a></h2>
<p>One thing was certain in his mind — mere &quot;awareness&quot; of the way universe worked, was not enough to attain peace. Just knowing the existence of &quot;One immutable and omnipresent Knowledge&quot; alone didn't get him the peace he wished for everyone. Not even conducting rituals to appease the deities. The path to knowledge was not in merely knowing its existence. It was in being one with the knowledge. How to get there was the unresolved question !</p>
<div style="padding-left:40px;font-size:0.9em;"> 
<p>The conundrum prevails even today. For example, when we see a computer, we all know the existence of programming languages. But just knowing the existence of &quot;programmability&quot; doesn't mean knowledge of programming. We must do certain actions to learn coding. The necessity to act was inbuilt into every endeavor — be it mining or weaving textile. <code>Maharishi</code> was intrigued with this power of actions. What is so potent in actions that leads to cultivation of knowledge? Building on his father's ideas, he named this potency <code>Karm Yoga</code> - though the underlying science of actions was still a mystery. It would take couple more generations and an incarnation of <code>Vishnu</code> himself (as <code>Krsna</code>) to fully explain <code>Karma</code>.</p>
</div>
<p>While young <code>Parāśara</code> had nothing going right for him, there was a silver lining - mother <code>Adrushyanti</code> was a kind grace. She kept his life together. An <code>Aacharya</code> herself, she was probably the only one who knew what <code>Śakti Muni</code> had on his mind. She made sure the child got his father's ideology - without aberrations.  She explained to <code>Parāśara</code> his father intended to unify <code>Naad</code> and <code>Nyaan Yoga</code>. The only way to get over the growing mistrust between the two streams  was to reunify both these streams under one banner - something new. That new unified stream was <code>Karm Yoga</code>. </p>
<p>The way <code>Sakti Muni</code> approached the puzzle was to ascertain the common denominator. He understood the core driver of both the <code>Yogas</code> was life-long dedication to one area of expertise. <code>Naad Yogies</code> dedicated their lives to &quot;recital&quot; while <code>Nyaan Yogies</code> gave up all the comforts for one unique area of exploration. A tight daily routine - controlled food and sleep, endless practice - made the <code>Yogies</code> what they appeared to the external world - the role models. <code>Karm Yoga</code> was, thus, an appropriate name for the new unified practice. </p>
<p><code>Śakti Muni</code> however, widened the scope of <code>Karm Yoga</code>. He argued if consistent actions could lead to divine recital and research, then the method would work for mundane tasks as well. He believed one can be a <code>Karm Yogi</code> irrespective of the work they were pursuing. It didn't matter to him if one was a &quot;reciter&quot; or a &quot;weaver&quot; as long as they had intense focus on their objective, and tenacity to stick to one thing - generation over generation -  just like his own family. He professed it was the lifelong practice that made one excel - it opened new horizons - even for one grazing the cows. In fact, he believed one should adopt their family work for a child learns best from her parents. Children should build on the family business. The idea was adopted, in letter and spirit, by many elite houses. So much so if a child wanted to do something outside the family traditions, they were termed <code>Varn Sankara</code> - the destroyer of family values.</p>
<p>While <code>Śakti Muni's</code> ideas had vision, and he pursued them with conviction, they failed to deliver consensus. The power brokers questioned him. They reasoned - how can a <code>Nishaad</code> (hunter) be same stature as a <code>Naad Yogi</code>? And if someone could attain <code>Karm Yoga</code> living with their families, doing their paternal chores, than who would join the congregation? </p>
<p>The idea of unification meant a natural degradation of the existing beneficiaries. It had commercial ramifications too.  If a <code>Chandal</code> (one who burns the dead) is same stature as a <code>Naad Yogi</code> than he too must render his services free. And if everyone worked for donations, it would be a systemic erosion of accountability. They felt <code>Śakti's</code> path would lead to anarchy. They thought his ideas were impractical, since he had no experience of running a state. <code>Vishwamitra</code> - other <code>Bramhrishi</code> wasn't a saint by birth. He was a king in his early life. He claimed the title of <code>Bramhrishi</code> the hard way - through intense work on skills. But more importantly, he understood how to effect a change in society. It was believed he didn't approve the theoretical designs of <code>Śakti</code> - thus, the theory that <code>Kalmashapada</code> was instigated by <code>Vishwamitra</code>. Though no one knew for sure because <code>Kalmashapada</code> was never caught or tried.</p>
<p><code>Sakti's</code> approach cast a spell of uncertainty on the barter system<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#barter">1</a></sup> too. The concerns were not totally out of place. Barter system was fine for high value transactions, but it was not scalable. Most of the families were self-sufficient in terms of growing their own food and cattle for milk. They built their homes themselves. Barter was used in rare events that could be easily accounted for. If everyone was expected to master one specific skill, there must be a barter value attached to every service. The open door society was not used to exchanging meal for a meal. One could simply knock on a door for food or shelter.</p>
<div style="padding-left:40px;font-size:0.9em;">
<blockquote>
<p>The indirect beneficiary of specialization was in fact the congregation. It became incumbent on the congregation to ascertain the exchange value for output of one hundred skills - most important being the metals, herbs and produce. Humans discovered the idea of &quot;proof of work&quot; for the first time. One could trust the exchange rates fixed by the congregation because only congregation could impartially estimate exact quantum of work needed for say a bushel of rice verses that to purify a <code>seer</code> of copper. It was only a matter of time for gold to become &quot;store of value&quot; because of its immutable imperishable properties and scarcity.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>On the other side, the &quot;old&quot; wanted status quo - the jungle rule. They saw <code>Sakti Muni</code> as a dangerous bridge to the &quot;new world&quot;. Up until now, the path of <code>Yoga</code> was for a select few - those who would sacrifice the pleasures to take on the hard life of <code>Ashramas</code>. <code>Śakti's</code> ideas could spread beyond the confines of <code>Ashrams</code>. They feared <code>Karm yoga</code> might become a household name. They saw  <code>Śakti</code> as the emerging face of a revolution that could carry a commoner with him. If a &quot;skill oriented society&quot; as a concept was mass adopted, their power to recruit people free would be severely restrained - particularly in crunch wartimes.</p>
<div style="padding-left:40px;font-size:0.9em;"> 
<p>Before the &quot;new&quot; replaces the &quot;old&quot;, many variants must converge to offer one unified path. Compromises must happen. Common denominators must be established. In essence, the &quot;new&quot; must represent &quot;Truth&quot; - the objective reality. Rules alone are not enough - they must percolate through rational consensus. That is the reason most global changes are always &quot;bottom and up&quot; not &quot;top and down&quot;.</p>
<p>It takes time for consensus to breed itself in the bottom half. A global change is thus arduous till it gets to the critical mass. Once it gets to the critical state, the change gets fast, and  irreversible - system adapts new constitution. On the way, the change agents stand to gain a lot - but they must be ready to pay ultimate price - their life.</p>
</div>
<p>No one knows for sure, but targeting <code>Sakti</code> appeared to be an easy way -  to crush the new revolution! And probably <code>Śakti Muni</code>, in a hurry to change the world, forgot to handle the balance of power his father <code>Vaśiṣṭha</code> had so carefully navigated. He didn't know abrupt change might cause ruptures never seen before!</p>
<h2 id="43"><a class="header" href="#43">4.3</a></h2>
<p>It wasn't that <code>Śakti Muni</code> made up a new word. The idea of <code>Karm yoga</code> was definitely older. Later in <code>Bhagwat Gita</code>, <code>Dwaipayana</code> scribed that <code>Karma</code> was the basis of manifestation and evolution.  He wrote: the supreme knowledge shared this secret first with <code>Vivswata</code> (Sun) who told it to <code>Manu</code> (the first man) at the dawn of Humans. In the first verse of Chapter four, <code>Krsna</code> - the embodiment of supreme knowledge said to <code>Arjuna</code>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This imperishable (system of) <code>Karm Yoga</code> I declared to Vivaswat: Vivaswat declared it to Manu; and Manu communicated it to Ikshaku. Descending thus from generations, the Royal sages came to know it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sun is the deity of light and time. It does change its course with seasons, but it does show up every day - to work. This repetitive nature was described as Sun's Yazna and of it came the four parts of the day - the most ancient measure of time. In <code>Vaidik Science</code>, each part was called a <code>Prahar</code>. With advent of sophisticated time keeping, we have divided the day into hours and minutes, but our new system has detached us from the motion of Sun. In <code>Vaidik Science</code>,  the first <code>Prahar</code> started with Sun Rise and fourth ended with Sun Set. The <code>Prahar</code> could be longer in summer and shorter in winter. The daily routine or <code>Yaznas</code> ; time for food, rest and play;  were designed to synchronize <code>Praharas</code>, by those who studied the eternal motion of Sun and it's effects in different seasons on different work streams. The effects on agriculture and medicine were quite evident though the system got extended to all skills in due course. Even different moods of music (<code>Raagas</code>) were tied to the parts of day (or night). Designers of the time system were jointly represented as a Deity - Sun.  In essence there was a full body of knowledge on time keeping. Underlying goal was to render humans a predictable lifestyle that focused on regular and repetitive <code>Karma</code>.</p>
<p><code>Manu</code> was the beginning of bipedal humans with well-developed hands to indulge in actions. This ability, available only to humans was the effect of immense practice by <code>Manu</code> - a humble reciprocation to emulate <code>yazna</code> of the sorcerer of life - Sun. In fact, humans are the only bipedal beings on planet earth. They dedicated two front legs to develop hands to indulge in sophisticated actions. Human hands are called <code>Karmendriyas</code> - the work organs. It is because of our hands and fingers that we could indulge in a vast range of actions (including scribing and typing). </p>
<p>Even prior to <code>Manu</code>, the story of evolution through various incarnations of <code>Vishnu</code> is the story of intense practice. <code>Sirla Bhaktivinoda</code> in his 1873 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashavatara">book</a> <code>Datta-kaustubha</code> and again in his 1880 book <code>Kṛṣṇa-saṁhita</code> premised <code>Vishnu</code> an evolutionary force. <code>Vishnu</code>, through his incarnations , takes consciousness to ever higher levels. From <code>Matsyavtara</code> (fish) to <code>Krsna</code>, <code>Vishnu's</code> incarnations kick-start a progression in consciousness through <code>Karm Yoga</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first incarnation of conscious beings was <code>Matsyavtaar</code> - the fish. Life was born in water  with singular sense of touch (possibly Amoeba). A fish, expanded the consciousness with the ability to see. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After millions of years in the water and a consistent goal to explore beyond water, led to the next incarnation of <code>Vishnu</code> -  <code>Kurma</code> - the turtle. How much consistent effort must a fish had done to accomplish this change! This effort was depicted equivalent to churning the entire ocean - <code>Samudra Manthan</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again after trillions of trials, the turtles developed a backbone and legs to lift them above the ground. The next incarnation of <code>Vishnu</code> is known as <code>Varahavtaar</code> - the incarnation into a boar. The first four legged being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was a period when quadrupeds started experimenting standing up but the hands and the tools for survival were not available. During this phase, <code>Vishnu</code> incarnated as a Lion-Man combination - <code>Nar Singh</code> to keep the bi-peddling efforts safe from the predators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next incarnation of <code>Vishnu</code> - <code>Vamanavtar</code> - a dwarf was the first with somewhat vertical back. Being able to stand on two feet, not only freed up the hands for sophisticated actions, in <code>Hathyoga</code> it is said to have opened the route for higher consciousness. As said earlier, <code>Naad Yogies</code> attained the skill of recital by moving the life energy to the upper <code>Chakras</code>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next one <code>Parshurama</code> was full human wielding an axe as a symbol of tools that conquered the lands. <code>Parsuram</code> was in lineage of <code>Manu</code>. The supreme knowledge imbibed from the Sun, invoked <code>Karm Yoga</code> into <code>Manu</code>. It explained to him that his generation with vertical spinal column and sophisticated hands were there to indulge in <code>Karm Yoga</code> - the very practice that led to their ability to stand tall. Only with practice they could survive and flourish. They must build skills to answer the final quest - understand the nature of supreme knowledge held with in.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Adrushyanti</code> explained the purpose of <code>Vishnu's</code> ever evolving incarnations to young <code>Parāśara</code> in narratives that accommodated him imagination. She explained to him there was no way for the waterborne and the amphibians to know who they were. The quadrupeds were able to recognize their fleeting reflection in the water and on the lands. They chased their shadows not knowing why could they never touch their own reflection. In absence of vocal communication, they couldn't even confirm (with their network) that the reflection was actually their own selfie - and that the selfies are always just a fleeting reflection. They can at best be a starting point of the eternal quest but by no imagination the true shape, for the true shape is in the reflection of universal mirror. All that we see and feel and touch is nothing but us. Our &quot;reality&quot; is our true selfie.</p>
<p>Young <code>Parāśara</code> was captivated by the ideas of evolution and the ultimate purpose but much like everyone else, he had no clue how to be one with the knowledge. How to find himself in million shades of the reality! As he grew up, this knowledge took shape of <code>Vishnu Purana</code>.</p>
<h2 id="44"><a class="header" href="#44">4.4</a></h2>
<p>While <code>Maharishi Parāśara</code> was pondering over the ideas of <code>Karm Yoga</code>, there was another parallel movement happening on <code>Naad Yoga</code> side — <code>Bhakti Yoga</code> — the <code>Yoga</code> of extreme devotion. Many of the <code>Aacharyas</code> had built a mass following. Almost like a cult. Their ideas based in grand vision of public good, but the underlying goal, to (also) promote their own moat. Many walled garden were formed. The followers developed blind faith in the words of the high priests. They even translated their narratives (or discussions) into local dialects and narrated them in poetical stories. So much so, the followers started believing mere chanting the names of their <code>Gurus</code> could get them to eternal peace. These narratives, mostly in spoken format, were called <code>Puranas</code> - the old stories.</p>
<p>In a way, <code>Puranas</code> are essential for proper appreciation of <code>Vedas</code>, for they provide the historical context. As we alluded earlier, thanks to the stories of <code>Vishnu</code> that mother roped in his <code>Sanskara</code>, <code>Vishnu Purana</code> was recited by <code>Parāśara</code> himself (later scribed by <code>Dwaipayana</code>). He told these stories to his disciple <code>Maitreya</code>, and they are among the most cited conversation in Hindu Mythology. Sometimes referred to as <code>Puran-ratna</code> — a gem among <code>Puranas</code>.</p>
<p>The oldest English translation of <code>Vishnu Purana</code> is available at internet archives. The book was published by H. H. Wilson (in 1864) in five volumes. The first volume is embedded here for reference.</p>

<p><code>Maharishi Parāśara</code> witnessed <code>Bhakti Yoga</code> evolving first-hand. The popularity of this tradition had <code>Maharishi</code> reassess the integrity of <code>Naad Yoga</code>. He was convinced that extreme devotion did open the entry into the power structure and thus material success, but he was not sure if it was a legitimate path to eternal peace (as promised). </p>
<p>At the same time he would wonder if he, himself, was on right trajectory. He thought the intense dedication of <code>Bhakti Yoga</code> was good, if it motivated the followers to indulge in <code>Karma</code>, but mere chanting didn't appear to him a passage to the eternal solace. In modern times we have many schools of meditation. There are numerous apps to help people meditate. All that is good as a relief to confused and tormented souls but they in themselves are not the solution. For the eternal peace is not in forgetting ourselves, it is in knowing who we are? The question was how?</p>
<p>There were many questions that still remained unanswered. Many mysteries unresolved! A <code>Nyaan Yogi</code> was caught in ‘duality’ — <code>Karm Yoga</code> or <code>Bhakti Yoga</code>.</p>
<h2 id="45"><a class="header" href="#45">4.5</a></h2>
<p>Age, didn't treat <code>Maharishi</code> any different. Despite his extensive work on understanding the manifestation <code>Vishnu Purana</code>, scribing of <code>Krishi Parashra</code> and path breaking research on Astrology, the quest to know the supreme knowledge was still unfulfilled. He knew he must have someone to carry the torch forward. And the answer was in Astrology. He believed it was a gift to fulfill the dreams of his lineage ..</p>
<p>After years of careful study of motion of heavenly bodies and their co-relation with birth of human intelligence, stars were finally aligned. <code>Maharishi Parāśara</code> was ready to take a child as his born son. And he named him long before the physical birth — <code>Krishna Dwaipayana</code> — Someone who would go beyond duality just like an island between two never-meeting banks of a river. Someone who could establish a middle spot among two never concurring ideologies — for the truth lies somewhere near the center. The literal meaning of <code>Dwaipayana</code> is ‘born on an island’.</p>
<p>And he saw the potent qualities in  <code>Matsyagandha</code>, as prospective surrogate mother.  Despite her ordinary circumstances, she honed in her, the curiosity and poise and the imagination, to gift this world an immortal writer !</p>
<h2 id="notes-and-stuff"><a class="header" href="#notes-and-stuff">Notes and stuff:</a></h2>
<hr />
<div class="footnote-definition" id="truth"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>That is the reason reality is <code>Kshra</code> - mutable. The parity symmetry of this mutable reality is immutable <code>Akshra</code> - the supreme knowledge. </p>
</div>
<hr />
<div class="footnote-definition" id="barter"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Imagine a world before written word. There were no written agreements. The &quot;promissory note&quot; was literally the &quot;promissory word&quot; called <code>Shapath</code>. A word once said must be held. Those who upheld their words were considered worth following. The clan of Rama <code>Raghukul</code> believed <code>Pran Jaye par Vachan Na Jai</code> - one might lose their lives rather than compromise their words. The idea held immense value in the barter exchanges of produce and metals.</p>
<ul>
<li>There used to be king's representative in every <code>Mandi</code> - the place for physical exchange of commodities in large quantities. Their job used to be equitable disposal of barter deals. For example if someone expected 100 <code>Seer</code> (kilo) of wheat for 10 <code>Seer</code> of copper, and found the wheat was only 90 <code>Seer</code>; instead of missing the deal , the wheat owner could promise in front of the king's deal makers to provide the remainder ten <code>Ser</code> say with in a fortnight. Failing which he was obliged to let go off a cow. These words were as material in king's court as a written agreement these days.</li>
<li>Spoken word was thus to underpin of barter deals. Once we moved to written words, the spoken word lost its value in commercial transactions - an obvious advantage to those who knew the skill of writing.</li>
<li>In a roundabout way, if some idea undermined the barter system, it inherently undervalued the spoken word. A threat to entire system built on the spoken word and hence the reciters that permeated the spoken word in society.</li>
<li>Goes without saying that the market makers had the immense power over producers or miners. Kings and their powerful allies could change the exchange rate of commodities to their advantage. They used the rituals and reciters to legitimize the new exchange rates. If they needed wheat for their armies, they could hold a ritual for more rains; mandating wheat would fetch much less copper or vice versa. </li>
<li>For writing to succeed, this commercial aspect of spoken word must be replaced by universal value exchange.</li>
</ul>

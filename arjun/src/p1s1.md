<center><h1>Karm Yoga</h1></center>

Getting lost in the actions such that our entire focus shifts to action rituals is `Karm Yoga`. Awareness of what the situation demands of you and doing exactly that. If the situation demands rising up to the challenges - then Karm Yoga is accepting the challange. If the situation demands to stay quiet than silence is the Karm Yoga. An obvious by-product of `Karm Yoga` is total loss of focus on senses - the consumption orientation. You may still consume if situation demands that , but you do it without the attachment to consumption - or any expectation from the situation. 

In `Maha-Bharata` the epic ; Krishna is depicted as the one who conceived `Karm Yoga` and followed through his examplery actions - `Leela`. His conversation with Arjuna , at the middle of the two armies, is not only a scripture, but it is also one of the finest piece of poetry by`Maharishi Ved Vyasa`. The goal of this first season, is to cover the chapter 3 of `Bhagvad Gita` that is fully dedicated to the topic and is a fascinating piece of conversation between two yogies on the battlefield.

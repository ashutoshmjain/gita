# Abhyasa: The Power of Practice

Human life is a profound gift. We are the care-takers of this land. Well being of all the species is incumbent on us because we have ability to make or break the planet. How did that happen ? How did humans took a quantum jump? 

We are set apart from other species by one unique ability - ability to train our minds quickly. 

While animals do adapt to new environments, they do so over many generations. Humans, on the other hand,  flourish with astonishing speed.  The evolution in the context of technology driven species is expansion of collective knowledge base. While the  knowledge is always limited to few expert minds (per field), the tools thus developed are available to the masses. For example - very few fully understand MRI scanners - soup to nut -  but scanners are available to all - even in rural cities. And hence an evolutionary jump to entire man kind. Same is true for all the open sourced code, AIs - even mass produced commodities and currencies.

Individually, our minds are general-purpose intelligence - capable of acquiring divergent skills. Our brains are not only good at acquisition of new skills, but retraining too - a trait that has allowed us spread geographically, and now we look toward to the stars. 

The all important question is: How this works? How do we learn? How do our minds acquires concrete skills! Lets begin with something we know for sure. We all know: practice makes a man perfect, but why? What is the fundamental mechanism that allows us to improve with each iteration? 

The answer lies in a philosophy of action and the incredible neural engine we carry in our heads.

### The Philosophy of Action: `Karma Yoga`

Bhagavad Gita offers a powerful framework to understand "actions".  `Karma Yoga`, literally means "connecting with actions". 

In most scenarios, when we act, our focus is on the outcomes. We are attached to the results. The key is to let go this attachment - detach from  cravings for specific goals - focus purely on the action. This is not about despising sensory pleasures or hating senses. Senses are necessary for our survival. It is about dedicating time to actions for their own sake - remember your childhood play-time. When action itself becomes the focus of our attention, the desires automatically take a backseat. Karmyoga is not about what you are doing - it is all about how you are doing it. 

Krishna says:

> *"One who initiates actions by regulating the senses with the mind, engaged in `Karm Yoga` with active work organs, and detached to the outcomes, that person is special. He excels."*

"Regulating the senses with the mind" means managing our emotional responses. We need to distinguish the metaphysical from the physical. Desires exist primarily in the metaphysical realm. Actions are always physical - even coding. By focusing on the action rather than its potential fruits, we connect with the real. We make practice a ritual, a `Yazna`, and unlock our potential for excellence. Such actions are known as an offering to the divine.

This idea is not just spiritual; it is grounded in the very structure of our biology.

### The Learning Engine: Our Neural Network

Our brain is the sophisticated learning engine. In `Hath Yoga`, it is symbolized by the `Sahsrara` Chakra - the crown chakra with a thousand `vritties` (expressions). It is a neural network of staggering complexity. For a perspective - a human brain connects roughly 86 billion neurons. Each neuron an average has 7,000 synaptic connections. This amounts to approximately 60 trillion parameters - give or take.  Compare it to the large AI model say GPT-3. It had about 185 billion parameters. Which means we have a neural net around 300 times larger than a typical large language model! 

Each of us hosts a super-intelligent, general-purpose AI, and there are over eight billion of us, collaborating and learning. This immense neural cloud of natural intelligence is continuously reconfiguring and evolving. The evolution is happening inside our brains - at a pace that dwarfs anything physical. In a way, the physical world is our training environment. And now with artificial intelligence, the evolution of conciousness is further accelerating.

Furthermore, this incredible processing power is seamlessly integrated with our "action organs." Our hands alone are connected to 200,000 neurons, translating to nearly one and a half billion synapses. The famous "Homunculus Man" illustration, which depicts the human body in proportion to the cortical area dedicated to its parts, shows our hands as enormous, highlighting their importance in our interaction with the world.

We are a complete package: a system designed for data collection, optimization, and testing through a continuous feedback loop. We are fundamentally built to explore our reality. This begs a question - what exactly is our reality? Is it the entire cosmos - the expanse of the observable or a tiny sliver that we may influence with our actions? Albeit, not to change that tiny box, but to learn from it!


### The Mechanism of Mastery: `Yazna` and Sleep

How do we train this biological beast? The process involves two key components: the ritual of action (`Yazna`) and the consolidation that happens during sleep.

When we repeatedly perform a set of actions—our `Yazna`—we are feeding our brain training data. Modern science has shown that during the REM stage of sleep, our brain gets to work. With the senses and motor controls temporarily offline, the mind rehearses past day's activities, running millions of simulations and tweaks to find the most efficient neural pathways. This is why, when we wake up, tasks often feel simpler, and we are better prepared. Each cycle of `Yazna` and sleep refines our abilities, making us more perfect with each iteration.

Evolution has prioritized REM sleep, even though it makes us vulnerable - a potential pray for predators. And arguably less productive. But it is a matter of definitions. How do we define productivity - with the work we perform in the physical world or the training we impart to our brains? How much work we get done may be important for survival but learning is the very purpose.
This is our evolutionary advantage. 

When we act on a specific problem set, with actions as our goal, the mind trains itself efficiently. However, if we make it brood over desires for specific outcomes, we divert its immense power to a simple, probabilistic computation. It tries to predict the chances of success, which, in a complex world, often results in a 50/50 guess. This uncertainty creates doubt, or `Sanshya`.

By providing our mind with the clean data - that of actions; it becomes a self-learning supercomputer. By asking it the wrong questions - those about outcomes, we create a mess of doubt that often requires sedatives to quiet. In our modern world, filled with distractions, `Karma Yoga` thus offers a proven path forward. A doubtless mind sleeps well!

### The Uniqueness of Skill

The result of this iterative process - actions and sleep -  is called a skill. It is a marriage of intelligence and knowledge. Intelligence gathers the training data, and knowledge is the optimized routine our neural engine produces. The knowledge is deeply personal and cannot be communicated. Fire cannot burn it, and air cannot dry it, for it exists beyond the manifested realm.

This is why a skill is uniquely yours. You can write down the steps to swim, but you cannot transfer the embodied understanding of how *you* swim. That knowledge is decrypted from your personal copy of the universal consciousness, the `Bramha`. We each hold a small, unique piece of the whole. By mastering even one tiny skill, we bring something to the "potluck party" of collective knowledge, granting us access to the entire evolutionary feast. The process of mastering the skill is ultimately more important than the skill itself. As Krishna advises:

> *"Nityam Yazne Pratishtitam"*
>
> *"Situate yourself into your `Yazna` everyday."*

He doesn't specify the type of ritual, because the nature of the work is secondary to the dedication of the practice.

### Redefining Purpose

This brings us to the concept of "purpose." We often define purpose as a future state or an accomplishment we must chase. This is `Sakaam Yazna`—action performed with a desired outcome in mind. While not inherently bad, the Gita suggests it is not the optimal path to peace and knowledge.

Instead, consider "purpose" as a complete focus on the actions required of you in your present situation - to train your mind. It is a shift in vantage from "where should I be?" to "what does this moment ask of me?" Millions of choices have led you to where you are now. Purpose is not about changing yourself into someone else; it is about realizing who you are through mindful action in your current reality.

The ignorant and the wise may perform the same actions, but their motivations differ. Krishna explains:

> *"The way ignorant people, attached to outcomes, perform their duties with passion, the learned must do the same for the greater good (evolution), but without any attachment."*

### Knowing Yourself Through Action

Ultimately, developing a skill is a process of knowing yourself. A marathon runner knows their own heart rate, the limits of their knees, and the fuel their body needs. By making every aspect of life—breathing, eating, sleeping—a skill, you come to know yourself intimately. Such a lifestyle is `Karma Yoga`.

> **A Practical Test**
>
> Let's approach one activity in a new way. Choose a fairly complex task you've wanted to try—cooking a difficult dish, running a 5k, or singing a challenging song. For one month, dedicate 30 minutes to it every day.
>
> Do this not to achieve an outcome, but simply to provide your mind with training data. You are not trying to become a master chef or win a marathon. You are simply giving your mind a chance to work. Do not let expectations creep in. You might be pleasantly surprised by the improvements you make as your body and mind optimize the routine.

So we now know - practice makes us perfect. 

But the question is - what prompts us to practice ? Who is the one asking this large model to do something. And keep on repeating till perfection is reached. If we are advised not to focus on outcomes , who is actually enjoying the outcomes? 

Who is the true consumer of all our sacrifices ?

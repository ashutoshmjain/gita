The purpose for **Converting Bhagavad-g카t훮 into English poetry**  , albeit through AI, is to make its profound teachings more accessible, engaging, and emotionally resonant for a wider English-speaking audience.

The original [Sanskrit](https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_giitaa/bhagvadnew.html) verses are compiled into English Poetry using Google's Gemini, and then rendered as a podcast with NotebookLM .

Show is available through  any podcasting app that supports [Podcast Index 2.0](https://podcastindex.org/podcast/7267041)

For best listening experience, please visit chapter pages by clicking the  cheeseburger on top left <i class="fa fa-fw fa-bars"></i> . There, you can listen to Spotify feed while reading the verses.

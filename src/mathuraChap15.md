Fairy was surprised to see a lunch invitation from her Brother. It read simple and straight - I am in the city. Lets grab some lunch together. Your place, my bill. 

She knew her brother too well to be surprised on the message. He thought the world must drop everything to attend to him! How do some people assume they are importance! - she thought.

"Your place, my bill" was a distress signal that he needed help. Something that he wouldn't take to Mother - his sister must bail him out. He was willing to eat lunch of her choice and also pay for it - a big accommodation from his standpoint.

She ordered a vegan salad with a white wine. Brother understood she didn't want to indulge - she wanted to keep it business - what are you up to? - she asked.

He bit big into his equally big Burrito - I need hundred coins that I would return with in six months - max. To his credit - he had never messed up the money part. Whenever she bailed him out - he dropped the funds back in with five and half percent interest, before time. 

But he had never asked for hundred coins before.

> Money was not a problem for they probably had thousands of coins - no one knows for sure except for the four trustees. The problem was - Fairy never had a feel for his motivations. He wanted to be the richest Wizard - the means were least of his concern as long as he adhered to the laws. He knew law must always be of the intent. Finding loopholes was a right approach for the code that ran the machine, but if you tried to find loopholes in the "code of conduct", you may find millions - yet he acted selfish and greedy. Probably, he didn't subscribe to the idea of "Truth". To him winner wrote the history and history was the only Truth. 

He spoke slower than his normal pitch - you don't wanna know this sister - I don't want to rock your relationship ! - and that is exactly what he wanted to do. And why not - that little Angel of dirt was trying to sabotage his biggest investment. And that was  after stealing one key to the trust. He not only  won Fairy's heart but his father too confided in Angel. He could never understand why his own father passed on his key to the Angel - how could he be same to his father as his own!

Go on - I am listening - she thought she was putting forward her stronger foot but she didn't realize she was being framed. 

Don't say I didn't warn you ! And you can't bring it on me. He knew Fairy would talk this over with Angel. All he wanted his name stayed out of it.

Fairy rushed back home - She knew the greed that comes with the riches and she barely escaped that world. She did sign the invoice her brother sent from his business account. She held one key of the multiSig Trust - Brother and Mother had one each and the last one was with Angel. They needed only two for with-drawls but anything more than one coin could be vetoed - one of the other two must decline with in six hours. 

In normal circumstances, Fairy wouldn't listen to anyone talking about Angel's work. If anyone knew - good for them - her commitment was to NOT know. And neither was that she couldn't find if she wanted to - information travelled much faster in her world. But this was different - it was about love.

---

Angel could sense the tension in the air - what is the matter honey - is it about the funds you authorized for your brother! He was getting an hourly notification to decline.

The question for Fairy was if she may brood or should she confront. She had thought of talking to the Friend first but decided against it.  How would she tell her that Angel was ready to risk love for his "career". How should she frame the idea that he was ready to "deep-sleep"  his mind - without even asking her - a state that may leave him altered into a different person - for ever. And all this to analyse the "unintended consequences" some random project - horse shit. She chose to confront.

Would you ask me if your work wanted you to go live on Mars for ever? - She asked. 

Angel couldn't look into her eyes. He knew he was living a lie but when must you tell your partner - what is that line ? - he wondered. Out loud he spoke - I am not going to Mars. It is just a small experiment -- a lie - they both knew.

A small experiment wouldn't take six months! - she was right. 

She knows it - he thought - there is nothing to hide and it is not important "who told her" - yet he tried. 

Before he could answer, they heard a bell. He looked at the monitors - it was Angel!. A twist of Fate !

---

Hope all well ! - asked Fairy opening the door - Angel right behind her.

Oh - Absolutely! Nothing serious - I was heading  to LA - I thought to soup up my car while I check on two of you !  - he paused for a bit - Hope I am not inconvenience!


> `Bhagya` (abstract noun)  - The generally accepted meaning of this Sanskrit word is "fate". If we peel a layer, the meaning reduces to the way things unfold in (immediate) present — our sensory reality.  
>
> Somewhat opposite of this word is "Destiny" — the long term outcomes. As an astrologer, `Maharishi Parashara` learnt early on —  one can predict the destiny, but it is impossible to predict the  "fate" — the nuances of the "present". 
>
> Think of our tiny box analogous to a  casino. We can't predict the result of a single hand. But we can assert the outcomes of say a thousand trials - with fair degree of accuracy. Which means we must be "present" for thousand trials. Which interalia means "time" makes things predictable.  We can't determine the movement of a scrip in short term, but a long term investment in a broad index always bears the fruits.  A knowledgeable player, thus, is never swayed by the coincidental outcomes. On the other hand, most people are lost in the pains (or elations) of the current moment. They bet on outcome of a single throw of dice. That is how "casino" always wins!

Tell me what's going on - Mentor casually asked. 

Angel thought he knew! May be it is the same source that leaked to Fairy also got to the Mentor. And may be it is best to talk this out in front of him -- He could vouch my role. 

Well - you know I had joined the sleep project.

Angel nodded - a bit surprised at the interrogation!

They now call it project Bonaventure. It is at beta release - they need certification for the "unintended consequences". 

What exactly are they doing? - Mentor didn't expect him as forthcoming with his work details. Something must have gone wrong - he thought.

The experience is somewhat new. It could be spun into many shapes - for now they pivoted on a learning environment. They claim you can learn something in a day that had take you six months in a rigorous school.

mm - How is the data ? Asked the Mentor.

Well - it's good.  At Alpha stage - no human died - 14 participants went more than eight hours of sleep - longest being 14 hours. Their body functions were normal. 53 returned safe on time and were fine. And rest reported weird dreams up-to say a month. It was a hundred sample size. I mean data is perfect.

He looked at Fairy - The reason I asked for six months because you need to "condition" your mind.

So you are basically turning yourself into a subject to test the Bonaventure ! - Fairy interjected - why don't you sign off based on the data ? 

And that is exactly what Brother wanted. He had genuinely believed this new certification had run max a week. And he had hoped Angel would be as excited to get this to the controlled beta as he was. Holding up a project of this size for six months needed money. He was on hook for his investors won't sign off till the certificate. A beta bioware is as good as general availability from all safety standpoints.

You must have talked to the participants - what do they say? - what do they feel? - Mentor wasn't  getting the dilemma.

Yes - I did. They don't remember any thing! Just like our normal sleep - we don't remember our dreams! - replied the Mentor.

So then what is the problem - Mentor was at the brink!

Well - first I can't analyse the "unintended consequences" without even "second hand" information. And second  they all converted millions of Sats to a their token "Bona" - the currency of "Bonaventure". But "Bona" has no public ledger. There is no record of the transactions. It seems all the money got sunk into a dreamland - with no further trace!

Oh - then it is clearly a drug influence the people into buying your coin - the Fairy interjected.

Well - there is no drugs -  no sensor injection - not even radiation - there is nothing illegal. I mean it is technically not a crime if consenting adults buys some yo yo token. 

Are they using scents - asked the Mentor ? 

Yes! - replied the Angel.

Well, you can't really tell the "unintended consequences" without first hand  experience. I mean you understood on your last project because you were bitten by the bees. Isn't that why you got the patched gene active..

What - that was a news to Fairy - were those bees dangerous !

She looked at the Angel - who had strange expression in his eyes..

I couldn't let you die so I told the story - the Mentor meant it. His love was visible.  And Fairy saw it. We have ability to know beyond facial clues. 

I am going in with you - she said. And she meant it. 

She picked up Angel's phone and vetoed the funds. Showing it to Mentor - I would let him talk to me again!

> You can't predict the "present" - the way things unfold ..

--- 

The call came in less than five minutes. It was on Fairy's phone

Your lover vetoed your authorisation - Brother said.

Actually I did that on his phone and you are on speaker - Fairy replied - I have one condition for this payout!

Brother thought his genius plan was falling apart but a smile came back to his lips as he heard the next sentence.

I am going in with him - she said.

Oh sure - more the merrier. I am sure you two will do the justice to "unintended consequence"

No one saw that a new idea cropped up in his mind - what if both of them were to be jailed there for just a day - in `Bonaventure`. With both there keys inactive for twenty four hours , he could ask for a transfer. The business of Trust can't stop !


# `Bhagya`

`Dashraj` woke up late, well past noon, thanks to the extra liquor, he consumed last night. He was barely through his morning routine when he heard a loud knock on his door. Who at this time ? His friends knew he hated visitors till evening, and girls had their own keys. The good thing, if any, about `Dashraj` was he never cared to put controls on the girls. They could come and go as they wished as long as they made some money for him. 

As he opened the door, he saw a horseman, ironclad and holding a flag of `Kuru` kingdom. A neighbor had guided him to the address and knocked the door for him. The horseman stepped down and bowed in respect as he saw `Dashraj`. 

Taking the king's stamp out in his hand, he said — `Shrimat Dashraj` (a respectful address, slightly more than a plain  "Mr." which is equivalent to `Shri` in `Hindi or Sanskrit`), I am here under instructions from the king of all lands and rivers, the emperor of vast `Kuru` kingdom `Maharaaj Shantanu`. The king has asked for your presence for a private council. I may wait here till the time of your convenience to ride with me — he pointed to another empty horse that he had brought for `Dashraaj`. The carefully dangling sword, and the muscles on the horseman were enough to let `Dashraj` know that saying a "no" wasn't an option, not that `Dashraj` wanted to deny himself this opportunity to see the king. He was always keen to meet people of power though being called upon by the emperor was beyond his wildest dreams.

Oh sure, let me dress up suitably for the respect of the king — as he was about to turn back inside, fate played the trick, he saw `Satyawati` walking back in. 

She wasn't surprised to see the `Kuru` flag at her door step. She knew `Shantanu` had promised to speak personally with her father. Without looking at the horseman, she stepped inside the big home. `Dashraj` checked with the horseman, if he or his horse needed water or anything else, to which he got a clever answer — Not till the work of my lord was done !

I don't know why the king wants to see me. Did I say anything wrong yesterday?  — `Dashraj` casually spoke to `Satyawati` — But then why would he want a private council rather then having me sent to a court ! — this time, as if he was talking to himself.

A smile broke up on her face. She first thought to let `Dashraj` have a "surprise", but decided against it for she didn't want to give old man undue stress — He might ask for my hand in marriage ! It was he who gave all that Gold yesterday !  — She said. She had no clue `Dashraj` was the last man to wish her a happy matrimony. 

Selfish and evil mind, as he was, `Dashraj` saw it as if king was trying to take away his most prized possession — his cash cow! No rich man could throw few pieces of metal and take away his life insurance — He thought — How am I going stop this?

The idea of denying `Satyawati` a marriage proposal was not new to `Dashraj`. Only difference was `Satyawati` was always with him in all those previous episodes. Sometimes he said "No" because the suitor was too old, other times he did so on account of financial standing. He even denied one wealthy young man because he didn't have a horse. This time, however, was different. How do you say a "no" to the emperor. Sure he was ten years older but such an age difference won't count for a royal wedding. But why am I thinking all these ? Maybe king wants to have `Satyawati` as a keep. It wasn't uncommon for rich to have women out of wedlock. In that event she could stay here with me. She could continue to earn from the boat while king might pay her for every visit.  

`Dashraj` thought many nefarious schemes on his way to the kingly camp. More he thought, more he saw the plan forming in his mind. Smile returned back to his face. He knew how to navigate this challenge. If the king really wanted to get `Satyawati` as a keep, it was a yes in his mind — a win win situation. If the king wanted to take her with him, then he must ask for a proper wedding. And if king agreed, then he must ask something that king won't ever give and yet never hurt him. 

And first of all, he must seek a pardon for his life!

On his way, he saw a royal caravan. `Kansa`, was returning after his morning session that `Shantanu` had requested. The request did come as a surprise to `Kansa`  but when he reviewed the message, he smiled at his good fortune. King had proposed to buy the haunted island though the island was as much in the kingdom as in `Kansa's` territory, for the rivers were always  "no man's land". An offer to buy a piece of land while `Shantanu` could easily take the island with force, appeared to be a friendly gesture in `Kansa's` mind.

King had asked for a fair price for a piece of land that literally had no value. He thought king probably didn't know the place was haunted. Whichever be the case, it was good for him for it offered him an interaction with the king and probably an obligation too. `Kansa` knew obligations worked. If he did one favor, he could count on a favor back. In addition, he wanted no conflict with the heart-land till his own problems at home were resolved — the biggest of which was `Vasudeva` who he must keep alive till he killed the eighth son of `Devki` . `Kansa's` pleasure had no bounds when the king offered one thousand gold coins for the island. This kind of money, he could use to build his army that he had use to reach farther East (and South) to tax more peasants. 

As `Dashraj` saw `Kansa's` long caravan pass by, the truth dawned upon him. He understood the power of the emperor. He must keep his nerve. He must keep quiet. And he must play as if `Satyawati` was his true daughter. King would never harm a father acting to safe-guard the interests of his daughter.

## 15.2

Just an hour earlier,  `Kansa` made a mistake. Unlike `Dashraaj` he didn't preempt or prepare for the situation. His dreams of one thousand coins shattered when King opened the discussion handing over a wooden block. They were not even seated!

`Kansa` do you know of such wooden seals circulating in your area of control ? - asked `Shantanu`. He purposefully didn't recognize him as a king.

A lie has no feet. Before `Kansa` spoke , his face gave in the answers.

`Maharaj` - I have seen them but !

Before he could complete - `Shantanu` played the trick.

We estimate there are ten thousand such forged seals in your area. I collected this myself to check on the claims of our agents. You will get your thousand gold coins when you hunt every one of them and submit to royal exchequer. I have sent a pigeon to `Dev` to appoint an accountant in your court to close this deal - hope it is okay!

Yes `Maharaj` - he felt fate saved him. In truth he was served a show-cause notice.

On his way back `Kansa` wondered who could have informed the emperor and was it so important that he himself showed up. He must proceed with caution. He had heard that `Maharishi` had some ties with the emperor. He must dig deeper for the emperor mentioned there were Agents watching `Sursena`. He tried to control his anxiety but it didn't work.

The King was happy and excited. First meetup with `Satyawati` was already bearing success. It felt a good omen. He didn't know fate had another trick left for the day. 


---

`Dashraj` bowed to the king for the longest time. He straightened up after many requests and then sat on the ground right near `Shantanu's` legs. A perfect display of humility. King stood up.  With his hands, he lifted `Dashraj`, and showed him a seat. He ordered the best wine for he knew `Dashraj` loved to indulge. `Dashraj` was already feeling thirsty for his mind had over-clocked since afternoon, when the horseman showed up at his door.

Coming straight to the point , King laid out his proposal — I want to marry your daughter `Satyawati`. 

The King was hoping  an easy "yes" followed with the best wine would be a perfect conclusion of this action packed day. He had already sent a messenger to `Maharishi` about the closure of island deal with `Kansa`. After a long time, he was eagerly looking forward to a real celebration. Maybe a reentry into life !

`Aho Bhagya` (great luck) to `Satyawati`..... `Maharaj` but .. — `Dashraj` played his silence card..

`Shrimat Dashraj` you appear to have something on your mind, say it freely — King asked a bit confused! He had expected `Dashraj` would be joyous.

`Maharaj` you probably know worries of a daughter's father, but how do I say it without a "pardon" on my life — `Dashraj` again went silent.

You have nothing to fear `Shrimat` — said the king, wondering even more as to what was there on `Dashraj's` mind — say it without any fear. Gods know, you have my word !

`Dashraj` tactfully hid his smile. He knew he got the king trapped — `Maharaj` if you insist, as a father of the daughter, I wish that the son from your union with `Satywati` be named your sole heir.

King felt a wave of anger that he thought he had forgotten long back. He stood up , his face red and body shaking. How can a lowly `Asura` make such a demand off the emperor. Do I really need his permission to marry a willing girl ? 

As the moment passed, he controlled his exasperation — `Dashraj`, you probably know, I have already named the heir. `Ganga Putra Dev` is going to be the king after me. You also know, in my lineage, such a decision can't be changed. I can do anything else for you if you want, but this ask is beyond me.

`Dashraj` kept silent. His eyes dug into the ground - `Maharaj`, I said so because you pardoned my life, and you insisted on the truth. You have all the powers. You can do whatever you like ! — His hands folded but he knew he aced this "act". If `Satyawati` stayed, his life was without any worries of worth or money, if the king agreed to change the heir, it had be the longest shot any one could dream from not only his village, but entire `Mathura`. People would know him as a "king maker", and he would have his place restored v/s oppressive `Maharishi Parashara`. His position among the `Asura` lords would be supreme, and his grand son would do to `Kuru` Kingdom what `Kansa` was doing to `Mathura` — a rise and revenge of his entire class !

There was nothing more to argue. Noting more to convince. King understood he was trapped in his own desires. A hole left after `Ganga` , that he wanted to fill up with life again, got even deeper. He felt ashamed that he permitted himself to fall. May be `Bhagya` has more tests for him. May be his life is meant to go loveless, and now meaningless too, for nothing will smell the same after `Satywati`. Nothing will taste and feel joyous. He wanted to run away. He let the despair out in a loud note to all his men — pack up, we will leave right now without waiting for the dawn.

He didn't know where he was headed ...

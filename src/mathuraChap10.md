# The Return ..

The village was in a state of shock when `Satyawati` made it to the docks. `Maharishi` had fixed her boat that it looked like new. `Matsya` was long gone from the memory of this village. She docked her boat and turned to a group of fishermen who were looking at her in disbelief — Is there a place to stay in this village and also who is the village head here? I wanted to seek permission to moor my boat in this dock.

The fishermen were speechless. They had never seen a more beautiful woman and her fragrance was driving them crazy. One of them offered her food that his wife had packed. Other offered to take her to the village head. 

The village head — `Dashraaj` in mid seventies, had seen the life long enough to be enchanted from anything glittering. Or at least that was what he thought. His ideas were forcefully changed by `Maharishi` but at the core, he still thought he had a role to play. His week eyes couldn't see `Satyawati` well enough, but he couldn't resist the smell. It was as if some Goddess stepped into his home. He stood up in respect and offered a seat and water to `Satyawati`. When she sought his permission to dock the boat, he didn't think twice. `Satyawati` saw the power of fragrance firsthand. She was happy. She kept on — Is there a place I could rent to stay. I have some gold. 

The word “gold” rang a pleasant bell in `Dashraaj's` ear — you are village's responsibility. You don't need to spend a penny. You are like a daughter to me, why don't you stay with us. I have three daughters who could help you on the boat.

The news of arrival of a beautiful noblewoman had already spread in the village. Men and women stopped at whatever they were doing and flocked to village head's home. Everyone was eager to help a single beautiful woman. Some applauded her for navigating rough `Yamuna` alone. `Satyawati` was stunned in the change. How could same set of people ignore poor `Matsyagandha`? It felt like `Matsya` actually died. Something in her told her she needed more power. Power to rule the entire world. She will never be as exposed and as needy as `Matsya` was. She must build on her gifts. She however, was not sure if the desires were taking over her if that was the right thing to do. May be `Krishna` would answer that one day! — she thought.

After few days of rest and enjoying cooked food, `Satyawati` returned to her boat. Along with her three `Dashraaj` girls. The older one slightly older than her and youngest slightly younger. Middle one was her age. They offered to help her on the boat. She was back in business as she saw a line of commuters growing to board her boat. She smiled and a song came to her lips. Life could be much easier for the rich and beautiful — she thought. The thought was soon replaced by the memory of `Krishna`. Every success must be paid in some form, some pain. She reminded herself that `Krishna` was with `Maharishi`. He couldn't have asked for a better father.

Time took the wings again.

`Satyawati's` boat got popular — like a tourist attraction.  People started pouring over just see her and listen to her sing.  And of course the fragrance. She got rich but she was still waiting for the next season of `Maharishi's` prediction. `Dashraaj` declared her as his daughter. There were many suitors who would happily surrender their lives' worth for `Satyawati`, but none of them could make her “rule the world”. More importantly, she was curious of the bigger cause that `Maharishi` said she was a part of. For now, she was content with love and respect that she know not existed. And she kept on sharpening her skills — music, singing, looking good and of course smelling good.

Back to his `Ashrama`, there was a welcome celebration for `Maharishi` and `Krishna`. No one asked about the mother for they were all busy checking out the toddler who could already speak broken `Sanskrit`. He had the `Gaytri Mantra` by heart. 

The apparent joy in `Ashrama` appeared a bit subdued to `Maharishi`. At the very first chance, he asked `Maitreya` if things were fine. When he found `Maitreya` quiet, `Maharishi` dug deeper. The waves of anger arose in `Maharishi` as he heard about the tax plan and house arrests of his friends. A part of him asked him to repeat the magic he had done in his youth but then other part demanded compassion. Afterall, what difference between him and `Kansa` if he too acted like a monster !

Time was of the essence. He called a general meeting of all the `yogies` later that evening — to announce a major initiatives — that the `Ashram` needs to be moved to the island. He told his disciples that the island was now free from curse since `Dwaipayana` was born there. And since it was out of `Sur Sena` boundary, `Kansa` had no jurisdiction. But moving a thousand strong congregation was not easy. Housing needs to be built ; jetty was a must and there were ton of other requirements to migrate the place. `Maharishi` sent a pigeon to `Shantanu` to summon his help if he or some of his leaders were around.

Later that evening, `Maitreya` talked about `Vasudeva` to `Maharishi`. His assessment was `Kansa` might have him killed sooner because he was the only valid stake to the crown. `Maitreaya` had friends in `Kansa's` council who had let out a note to `Maitrya` that `Vasudev's` days were numbered. The plan was to show as if he was trying to escape and back-stab him. The question was how to delay this inevitable.

Having thought about it together for an hour, they came up with a scheme. Given that it was impossible to get `Vasudev and Devki` out of `Kansa's` clutches, they must provide a good reason for `Kansa` to keep `Vasudev` alive. Their lives were precious even if it was behind the bars. 

Being an astrologer, people believed in `Maharishi's` predictions. Most of the times, he didn't want his name attached to the such prophesies. But this time it was different. `Maitreya` sent a pigeon to his accomplice in `Kansa's` council with a secret message that was supposed to be delivered to one of `Kansa's` real aid. It noted that `Maharishi` predicted death of `Kansa`. It said, once `Kansa` kills `Vasudev`, `Devki` too would die of grief and in their next birth, their eighth offspring would kill `Kansa`. It was important that `Vasudev` died because that was the only way to freedom for him and `Kansa` would never know where he was born again!

The message caused panic in `Kansa's` camp. It meant that both `Vasudev` and `Devki` must be kept alive till they have eight off-springs. And `Kansa` must kill the eighth. 

Even `Maharishi` was unaware that the eighth child of `Devki` was going to be the chosen one .. `Vishu's` seventh incarnation to deliver the lead role of `Krishna Dwaipayana's` epic ..

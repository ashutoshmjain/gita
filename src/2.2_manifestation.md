In the last section, we saw that if we feed our mind with desires of a specific outcome (good or bad) ; all our brain does is compute the realistic probability of occurrence. It does suggest a path to accomplish that goal but again you need to practice. The problem, however, is if we are starting with a desire, there is every chance that we might start chasing a new desire the very next day. Thus now we have a new action plan. Even if we hold our desires, the environment of our tiny box changes. That means the path to our expected outcome changes. Only thing constant in our tiny box is the change. The new realities often means we need to change the action plans or pivot onto something new. Thus we are constantly changing our actions without giving our brain enough reps to build a skill. In essence we are moving from one expectation to another without ever giving ourselves a chance. We are stuck into detours and then more detours with in those detours. In essence we get to a state that we ourselves don't know what exactly we are looking for. And every time our brain fails us on first attempts, we feel let down. Another reason to move on to something else. Does it sound like how we live our lives ?

In the last sections we also talked about the idea that the skills lead to manifestation. We understood that our brain - what we know as `Sahsrara Chakra` is a powerful neural network that helps turn repetitive actions into a skill. Skill means you can perform a set of actions effortlessly. You can test this idea in your own lab. Take any activity , say singing  or cooking or running or coding or a new language; and see how much you improve on 30th day of practice v/s the day you started. Practice makes us perfect. In a way, brain has added a specific knowledge to our actions routine. This knowledge allows us to effortlessly skate board while other people trying to mimic the routine fall on their butts. The problem is we never consistently practice enough to cross the threshold. Concious removal of desires to engage us in consistent practice - ritual of actions `Yazna` is the fundamental aspect of `Karm Yoga`. Gita adds emphasis on consistency that is a hallmark of stable brain `Sahsra`. Such a consistent person who engages in ritual of actions by regulating the senses and engaging the work organs is called `Sthit Prazna` - One with stable mind. Krishna says 

> Prajhati [ gives up ] Yada [when] Kaman [desires] , Sarvan [all] Parth [ O Arjuna ] Manogatam [one who is beyond fickle mind];
>
> Atmani [ self ] Eva [ certainly / only ] Atmna [ concious of ] Tushta [ satisfied ] Sthit Prazna [ stable mind ] Tat [ s/he ] Uchyate [ is called or known as ]
>
> When a man gives up all the desires of sense gratification and chasing the random goals ; and when his mind thus purified , finds satisfaction in self alone, then s/he is said to be of stable mind. 

Such a skilled person with stable mind manifests. If you are singer , then the manifestation can be a song. For a warrior, the manifestation is victory. For a writer its the words and for poet its the thought. In a way, manifestation is a proof of completion of first two stages - service orientation and skill capture. This is the door to the third stage where you may be called upon by the system for righteous application of your skills. There can be some wait here. But the call comes. 

The question is why should we manifest ? What is the point. The answer is simple. One it obviously completes our Yazna and second , the manifestation we do can inspire someone else to take on their ritual of actions. There is, however a catch, the manifestations can be appeasing to senses and as such cause bondage for other people as well as our own selves. The reason senses attract to the manifestation is they are enticing or else senses don't even look at them ; thus the risk of attachment. That is where the idea of renunciation comes in. 

If you see the graphic below, it is the manifestation cycle but the idea is where the renunciation come in ..


![](./au-manifest.jpg)

### Renunciation 

If we see the left side of the graphic above, the manifestations are engage us. We are tempted to indulge in them. We start chasing the expected outcomes. As the expected outcomes get distanced from the actions we take; our minds create the doubts because odds for such outcomes are at best a toss of coin. We feel as if our brains are confusing us. At this stage we try to shut down our thinking. We feel as if the most powerful tool that we have in our heads is our enemy. This is evident in our substance abuse. The path foreword to get out of such a situation is to cut the noise down. This is what we know as renunciation. Kinda forcefully take our mind off all the cravings we have. Stop using technologies and artifacts that consume us. The goal is to re-set ourselves so we once again have a clear view of our perceived physical reality. The goal is NOT to start hating or permanently give up everything. That kind of renunciation doesn't attract any real success. 

As we successfully gain a good hold of our ground, we need to initiate our journey of `Karma`, that is to re-skill ourselves for that is the only path to understand the true physical reality. 

The graphic also explains how we take everything from the manifestation cloud - `Bramha` and again all that we manifest through our skills goes back into the overarching system ; and in the process we decrypt the knowledge and gain peace. Once again a never ending cycle. Such a cycle is called `Kaal chakra` - the cycle of manifestations. 


Now, we should not start thinking that the manifestations that we do are somehow needed for our own survival. The notion of survival is already provisioned by `Bramha`  - the system. For examples fish don't need a sophisticated WMS or GPS to navigate across the oceans. Even birds fly across the oceans. This provision is called the basic material nature of eight things that is the basis of this creation. Gita calls it `Ashtadha Mool Prakriti`. Krishna says .. 

> Bhoomih [earth --> solids] Aapah [water--> liquids] Analah [fire --> energy] Vayuh [air- gases] Kham [space --> nothingness] Manah [fickle mind] Buddhih [Intelligence] Eva [certainly] Cha [and] ;
>
> Ahamkara [Ego - identity] Iti [thus] Iyam [all this] Me [my] Bhinna [different] Prakritih [manifest] Ashtadha [eight fold]. 
>
>Solids, Liquids, Gases , Energy and space (nothingness) along with fickle mind , intelligence and ego - all of these are basic manifest of this creation what Krishna calls `Ashtdha Mool Prakriti` - Eight fold basic nature. 


The first five are some time also referred to as `Jada` - lifeless and last three are referred to as `Chetna` - living. `Jada` are interchangeable from one to another. They are also called `Sthoola` means something that our senses could perceive - The solids, the air , the liquids. Last three are called `Sookshma` means they are too fine to be felt by senses - Intelligence, fickle mind and the ego - they can't be perceived by the senses. Senses are designed to take in binary inputs from the `Sthoola` wherein nothingness acts as a backdrop. 

Think of it as the eight fold nature of manifested. You can call them as the core services of the "Meta verse" , that we are building .. oh ..I mean we can easily build a virtual world for the Oculus Quest. The first thing we have is the physics engine. Which basically means we have provisioned the solids, the liquids and the gases. And the gravity. Well , in Facebook Metaverse you can fly so there is no gravity but it is not hard to imagine that we can easily hold your avatar to the ground  . Lets do it and see how it pans out .. 

So we figured out that we need the three basic constituents - that is air , liquids and solids - solids are something you can't pass through, liquids are something you can pass through but you will feel the touch and gases , you can of course pass through even without feeling touch. Only way to know the gas is through smell. Absence of all these three we will refer to as space. 

Since we have the rules of physics active in this virtual world that we are building means we need to enable our inhabitants with energy to abide by the rules. Every time you need mobility in this place, to feel the solids , liquids and gases , to cut through them , to reshape them as per the laws , you will need energy. Energy can pass through the space or any of these three we created but unfortunately there is no sensor for playing with energy in our system. We can feel if we need it but it is not something we can play around as in case of solids or liquids.  In a way, it is a good design idea because we are going to use energy as a catalyst. We are not planning to make a home or office out of energy. 

The down side is this means we  are always confused if it is a wave or a particle because we just don't have direct  sensor for energy. Otherwise we have provisioned  a primary sense for all the things we created , I mean that is how we interact with them , for example we give touch for solids , smell for gases and taste for liquids. Will talk in detail on these sensors when we discuss our senses in detail in ensuing chapters. 

So we got all the non living things - the five elements what Gita refers to as `Panch Bhoota` ; what about the manifestation of us ? The concious agents. Well we got a sense for each of the elements. Question is how does the concious agent remembers the interactions with these objects and improve on them. That is the reason we need to put in some RAM. Obviously we can't put in too much of storage in there because we need the concious agents to be exploring. Mobility is the key need and so is survival. Why not give a small fast memory or and provision a mechanism to process the data with global compute when agents are inactive - let us call it sleep. So we build a localized brain and a mandatory sleep. All in the metaverse. 

The fact we have a small efficient RAM means we need to purge the irrelevant data. How do we do that. We need a mechanism to purge that memory from cold data. That's where we built the notion of time.  So in addition to senses the concious agent now has mind to navigate the survival through what we call `Buddhi` - intelligence. This is basically to receive data from the sensors and then we have the access to massive connected neural engine through a sleep interface what we refer to as `Chitta`. And we have time because we want our local memory to be efficient. 

Turned out with all the sensors as well intelligence, the agents are still not curious enough to engage with the world. The metaverse is turning to a "Second Life" ; there is not an evolutionary engagement. So we need to do two things - one to incentivize developers more immersive manifestations as well as we need to create a fickle mind in conscious agents. A faculty of mind that wont let them seek peace; rather make them chase new things , explore new locales, smell new smells, drink new potions - fickle mind. This is what Gita refers to as `Mana`. Intelligence is to `Chitta` - deep mind what curiosity to `Mana` - the fickle mind. 

You guessed it right , even now the world is a calm place. There is no conflicts , no conspiracies , no life. So we need to add something - how about an inflation of our immediate physical world - Identification with friends , family , nation , tribe , race and species. This sounded awful to purists but this is what brought life to the metaverse. So we got an identity - ego what Gita called `Ahemkara`. 

So we have a ready concious agent ; with Senses to observe the elements and other manifestations, Intelligence to gain information, Deep mind to process the information , work organs to interact with the elements and manifest , Curiosity to indulge and an identity that narrows our focus to who we are ? Well, you may say this sounds like an intelligent design ; yup we have , I say thins not because Krishna said so . I say this because this is what we are doing. Given what we did with compute in last thirty odd years , do we have any doubts that we will build not one but thousands of virtual realities. With different set of physical rules. We have transformed machines to intelligent machines and them to virtual intelligent machines - from post office to virtual post box on email server ; from real to online retail . Does anyone has a doubt that we all collectively - and that includes trees in your back yard because they give the oxygen to us to act - we are collectively evolving into a new virtual world. And the speed is only going to enhance from here on . We are basically doing what we are. We are building super conscious agents. We are transforming ourselves into the God. But all this is what we call evolution because we need to iterate endlessly to get to a better design. "Second Life" failed but `Grand Theft Auto ` is working. Play station home failed but Horizon home might work, who knows what is next after self driving cars. I am already investing in eVTols. Arriving at a design that looks intelligent is an evolutionary process. Only the best and fittest survives. 

The real question is what does it mean if a concious agent wants to exit the virtual reality. Is there a way ?

Let us say you are building a jigsaw puzzle. A huge one. There are thousands of little pieces. Even bigger number of edges that must fit with each other to finally shape up the puzzle. It feels almost impossible that someone can put it together. The only information that you have is;  it will finally become a beautiful picture of you - you and your fiance. All the pieces are sitting there in a big poly pack on your dining table and you are too busy to look at them. Why would someone gift you a puzzle on your engagement. You wonder and curse the soul of your cousin who came up with this idea. You already kinda know your fiance is the last person who will help you put this together. You still talked to him casually but you know he would rather spend time on video games !

Finally, one day , almost a month after your engagement ; when things sobered up in your mind, you got done with all the exciting stuff , and the chores; you took the challenge up - alone. No one there to help you. Your family is bunch of jokers who can't even put a picture in a frame. You can't imagine them coming to your rescue. Only thing you know is "it will become a beautiful picture"  and it is going to take many days. Many many iterations. It is a process - It is a `Yajna`. 

First day you spread the pieces on the table. Wondering where to start! Luckily the pieces for your big glasses showed up. It was just a coincidence that the first thing you saw was your eyes. That day you looked for every single piece that can fit together to make your eyes. And the thick glasses on them. You must have turned five hundred blocks to get the eyes together. It was love of labor. You drank two beers to keep you going that evening. 

Next day, while brewing  your coffee, you were automatically pulled to the dining table. May be I can fit another piece ..Luck favoured , the lips showed up. It is as if someone is helping you inside. 

## Manifestation 
The picture on the  jigsaw puzzle is the information you received with the puzzle  that was sitting on your dining table. You toiled for ten days to decrypt the knowledge. But you didn't decrypt the picture !  What you decrypted is the skill to put the puzzles together. That is the knowledge you gained out of this `Yajna`. This knowledge will help you put any other jigsaw together faster than me. 

In the process you manifested a beautiful picture of you and your fiance - from a disorderly poly bag to a nicely spread one on the dining table. It looks so good on the table that your mom took a picture and posted it on Facebook. Every guest who shows up at the dining table to eat their meals , marvel at the picture rather than the wine. Lost in their food and wine , they have no clue how it was done. All they know is a picture, that was broken into many pieces can be put together if someone spends time. Exactly the same information that you knew before you started your jigsaw puzzle. Only thing is this form is more way more inspiring than the one you started with . That was a challenge. This is an inspiration. We will see down the line how information mutates ; for now let us focus on the manifestation .. 

> A yajna is thus the process of making the information more palatable. Information stays the same. Knowledge still remains encrypted in the final manifestation. People can consume the information but it mutates based on their respective motivations. 

A manifestation is important because unless you manifest , you wouldn't know if the part of the knowledge that you intended to decrypt is fully done or not. Manifestation is a proof that you decryped some knowledge. Something that you can't commnicate but it does inspire people or throws them a challenge or could even create fear. It all depends on the receiver of the information. 

I hope this metaphore helps in differentiating knowledge , manifestation and information. These are fundamental concepts of `Yajna`. Gita says your goal is to decrypt the knowledge. Manifestaion is just a proof of completion of your `Yajna`. As for information,  manifestation itself is a communication, you don't need to spend any time on it because you have no idea how the information motivates the receiver. A seeker will always find the relevant information - and they already have THE GOOGLE :-)

### Why knowledge is cryptic
Encrypted doesn't mean it is hidden. It is right there but it takes much larger effort to understand it. Our senses can not prioritize enough time to understand every single detail. Effectively, if someone wants to learn from your experience ,  they will need to go through all the ten days worth of effort themselves to understand what you learnt ; even then their learning will be different. Thus it is more useful to consume the manifestation (with our senses) and be inspired from it to do something that you intend to learn. 

In other words - you can take the mesh as a template, but you will need to fill up every cell with your own knowledge.  For example this book is information. If you read this, it will only create a structure in your mind. You will need to fill in this structure with your own Yajna. 

### Information Reception.
Let is continue with the "Book" metaphore ...

You don't need to publish the book on Amazon, the moment you wrote the book, that book itself is the communication that you have decrypted "writing" as a skill.  In a way its brochure for sensory consumption  (manifestation) got registered in the universally distributed block chain. Any seeker conscious agent can check it out. This is the primal registry of all the information. It keeps a record of all the manifestations. As the new and better manifestations come in , the older ones are rendered useless. They are purged or go into cold data store. No one any way wants buy old cameras any more cuz you have GoPro Hero now.

In a way, communication is for one who is truly seeking. Push notifications are pretty much a waste of time - rather distractions.  If you look at Google's home page - it is just a blank white page with a single dialog box. It asks you what you are looking for. It does shorten your time to reach where you wanted to be but it is only as good as your quest. Facebook feed takes it to a new level. It tries to predict what you should look at. In a way you outsourced your quest to Facebook. Good or bad ? is upto you. If you think you don't even know what you are looking for , Facebook a good way to waste the only currecy you got - your time. 

In essence, spending too much time in making your manifestation "visually appealing" or "easily searchable", is the time taken away from the `Yajna` - without much benefit. Because the seeker will find your manifestation if it worth. Non seekers will never even look at it no matter how many times it shows up on their feed. Even if they glance or swipe at it , they will receive a mutatated version. They will always see your creation through a colored glass. 

Your intent to manifest was to complete your Yajna. If you are lost in getting the clicks then you are anyway attaching the desires that will lead to the  "pain - happy" cycles. 

## Yajna
`Yajna` is thus the process of decrypting a piece of [protected] knowledge. Converting it it into a skill and then manifesting something more inspiring than what you consumed. 

You get four  things  out of Yajna. 

- A piece of decrypted knowledge that stays only with you. 
- An artifact for sensory consumption. For your  own self or other conscious agents. 
- Peace for you as long as you are consumed in the actions. Even if you didn't want to do it in the beginning , as you indulge in the actions , the peace starts flowing in. You lose sense of time. 
- Help - Your practice pulls you in. As if someone is holding your hand. Giving you the clues. Game has help built into it. As you cross one bridge, your sight automatically clears up for the next. After few rounds, you don't need to look at the manual anymore. You kinda start knowing what is the next thing. 

### Sakaam Yajna 
You can choose to attach a favorable outcome with your manifestation. Means you can make a wish that the book you wrote, will sell a million copies. It has nothing to do with your book. If there are a million seekers, you will feel happy. If there is no taker, you will curse Amazon:-) Means cycles of pain and happiness. 

If you want your manifestation (book in this case) to be successful, you will put in more effort in it but you will also carefully withhold something so that it doesn't become a sensory overload. Which means most of your focus shifts to the configuration that is best consumed. Is it a live performance - e.g a book reading or it is an audible ?  What is the best price ? What "information" you put on the cover ? . Effectively you are spending more and more time in decorating information than the knowledge that you are unlocking. More effort you spend on improving the consumability , more you are raising your expectations. A million copies , ten million clicks ... Not only you are spending less time on actual content (practice), you are raising your own bar of happiness. Result can be a huge elation or big despair - beyond your control. BTW there is nothing wrong if you are into it to play the game but know that it is a game with random results as soon as the outcome expectations go beyond a certain degree of separation from the work you been doing. 

The bigger the expectations, less likely they are to manifest. Effectively what you learn from such Yajnas is what "Not to do"  or make you action less. Whereas if you went in with a low or no bar, you will always be in for the actions. 

### Nishkaam Yajna 
If you choose to attach no outcome with your manifestation - you wont even publish it on Amazon. You wrote the book. You gained the knowledge . You got the writing skills. You manifested the book just  to confirm the skill and complete your `Yajna`. That is it. By the act of writing , you already registered the communication that a book exists. You have no further expectations. Means you are at peace. 

Most of the chores that we do on daily basis are a type of `Nishkaam Yajna`. You don't publish you mopped the floors or fed the dogs. We may not want to indulge in them but we know doing them always gives us peace. Service is a `Nihkaam Yajna` . 

### Wasted Effort
The sensory inputs that we consume in are good, if they inspire you to get into your own `Yajna`. If you are just consuming for pleasure or if you are adjusting your actions (not Yajna) , to seek a pleasurable outcome (Jackpot) - Gita calls it "Wasted Effort"  - `Vyartha Cheshta". Wasted effort not only wastes your time, it increases the bondage with sensory reality. And thus leads to cycles of pain and happiness. Mostly pains because happiness is normally attached to one specific outcome - wherever possible outcomes are very many more. 

> `Nishkaam Yajna` Is the way to peace. We will see how and why down the line .

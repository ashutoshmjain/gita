`Bhagya` (abstract noun)  - The generally accepted meaning of this Sanskrit word is "fate". If we peel a layer, the meaning reduces to the way things unfold in (immediate) present — our sensory reality. 

Somewhat opposite of this word (in English) is "Destiny" — the long term outcomes. As an astrologer, `Maharishi Parashara` learnt early on —  one can predict the destiny, but it is impossible to predict the  "fate" — the nuances of our sensory reality. 

There are infinite possibilities, triggered by just five senses, when they experience the variations of our "real verse" — our tiny box. Our emotions, actions, feelings, pains and elations — all live in this moment. Modern Hindi poet `Ayodhya Singh Upadhyay 'Hariaudh'` describes the possibilities — `Bhagya` — in his famous poem `Ek Boond` — a droplet of rain. He says as a droplet leaves the clouds, she wonders what is in store for her?. Will I diminish in the dirt, or will I burn in some fire?


> Dev mere bhagy mein kya hai bada
>
> main bachungi ya milungi dhool mein?
>
> ya jalungi gir angaare par kisi?
>
> choo padungi ya kamal ke phool mein?
>
>---
> O deity of luck, what ills wait in my fate?
>
> will I live, or lay on dirt to rot?
>
> or fall, to burn on ember hot?
>
> or will I seep into an open lotus flower [^pearl] ?

It might appear that the fate pushes us in different direction — sets us up on a new course;  but overall sum of all those changes, in the long term, evens out. Hence, the long term future is predictable. Thus astrology may predict only long term future. Present day nuances of our sensory reality are indeterminate. 

Think of our tiny box analogous to a  casino. We can't predict the result of one single hand. But we can assert the outcomes of say a thousand trials - with fair degree of accuracy. Same is true for say stock market. We can't determine the movement of a single scrip in short term, but a long term investment in a broad index always bears the fruits.  A knowledgeable player, thus, is never swayed by the co-incidental outcomes. Their focus is always on the righteous actions. On the other hand, most people are lost in the pains and elations of the current moment. They bet on outcome of a single throw of dice ! They are never tired of trying out their luck ..

# `Bhagya`

`Dashraj` woke up late, well past noon, thanks to the extra liquor, he consumed last night. He was barely through his morning routine when he heard a loud knock on his door. Who at this time ? His friends knew he hated visitors till evening, and girls had their own keys. The good thing, if any, about `Dashraj` was he never cared to put controls on the girls. They could come and go as they wished as long as they made some money for him. 

As he opened the door, he saw a horseman, ironclad and holding a flag of `Kuru` kingdom. A neighbor had guided him to the address and knocked the door for him. The horseman stepped down and bowed in respect as he saw `Dashraj`. Taking out the king's stamp in his hand, he said — `Shrimat Dashraj` (a respectful address, slightly more than a plain  "Mr." which is equivalent to `Shri` in `Hindi or Sanskrit`), I am here under instructions from the king of all lands and rivers, the emperor of vast `Kuru` kingdom `Maharaaj Shantanu`. The king has asked for your presence for a private council. I may wait here till the time of your convenience to ride with me — he pointed to another empty horse that he had brought for `Dashraaj`. The carefully dangling sword, and the muscles on the horseman were enough to let `Dashraj` know that saying a "no" wasn't an option, not that `Dashraj` wanted to deny himself this opportunity to see the king. He was always keen to meet people of power though being called upon by the emperor was beyond his wildest dreams.

Oh sure, let me dress up suitably for the respect of the king — as he was about to turn back inside , he saw `Satyawati` walking back in. She wasn't surprised to see the `Kuru` flag at her door step. She knew `Shantanu` had promised to speak personally with her father. Without looking at the horseman, she stepped inside the big home. `Dashraj` checked with the horseman, if he or his horse needed water or anything else, to which he got a clever answer — Not till the work if my lord is done !

I don't know why the king wants to see me. Did I say anything wrong yesterday?  — `Dashraj` casually spoke to `Satyawati` — But then why would he want a private council rather then having me sent to a court ! — this time, as if he was talking to himself.

A smile broke up on her face. She first thought to let `Dashraj` have a surprise, but decided against it for she didn't want to give old man undue stress — He might ask my hand ! It was he who gave all that Gold yesterday !  — She said though she had no clue `Dashraj` was the last man to like her get into a happy matrimony. 

Selfish, as he was, `Dashraj` saw it as if king was trying to take away his most prized possession — his cash cow! No rich man could throw few pieces of metal and take away his life insurance — He thought — How am I going stop this from happening !

The idea of denying `Satyawati` a marriage proposal was not new to `Dashraj`. Only difference was `Satyawati` was always with him in all those previous episodes. Sometimes he said "No" because the suitor was too old, other times he did so on account of financial standing. He even denied one wealthy young man because he didn't have a horse. This time, however, was different. How do you say a "no" to the emperor. Sure he was ten years older but such an age difference won't count for a royal wedding. But why am I thinking all these ? May be king want to have `Satyawati` as a keep. In that event she could stay here with him. She could continue to earn from the boat while king might pay him for every visit — `Dashraj` thought many nefarious schemes on his way to the kingly camp. More he thought, more he saw the plan forming in his mind. Smile returned back to his face. He knew how to navigate this challenge. If the king really wanted to get `Satyawati` as a keep, it was a yes in his mind. If he wanted to take her with him, then he must ask for a proper wedding. And if king agreed, then he must ask something that king won't ever give and yet never hurt him.

On his way, he saw a royal caravan returning. It was `Kansa`, who was returning after the morning session that `Shantanu` had requested. The request did come as a surprise to `Kansa`  but when he reviewed the message, he saw a win win situation. King had proposed to buy the haunted island though the island was as much in the kingdom as in his territory, for the rivers were always  "no man's land". King had asked for a fair price for a piece of land that literally had no value. He thought king probably didn't know the place was haunted. Whichever be the case, it was good for him for it offered him an interaction with the king and probably an obligation too. `Kansa` knew obligations worked. If he did one favor, he could count on a favor back. In addition, he wanted no conflict with the heart-land till his own problems at home were resolved — the biggest of which was `Vasudeva` who he must keep alive till the eighth son of `Daviki` came into his hands. `Kansa's` pleasure had no bounds when the king offered one thousand gold coins for the island. This kind of money, he could use to build his army that he had use to reach farther East and South to tax more peasants. 

As `Dashraj` saw `Kansa's` long caravan pass by, the truth dawned upon him. He understood the power of the emperor. He must keep his nerve. He must keep quiet. And he must play as if `Satyawati` was his true daughter. A king would never harm him if he was convinced that he was acting in the interest of a girl whom he loved.

---

`Dashraj` bowed to the king for the longest time. He straightened up after many requests from the king and then sat on the ground right near `Shantanu's` legs. King stood up and with his arms he lifted `Dashraj` and showed him a seat. He ordered the best wine for he knew `Dashraj` loved to indulge. `Dashraj` was already feeling thirsty for his mind had over-clocked since afternoon ever-since the horseman showed up. 


### Research and Notes
[^pearl]: Since a lotus flower stays up above dirt and water, a droplet may retain it's own if it was held in a silky lotus flower. A good outcome from droplet's standpoint.

Most of the movies you go to watch, you probably already know the end. A good movie however is the one that keeps you guessing and ends with a surprise - an unexpected outcome. A movie would be too bland if nothing surprising happened. Even a documentary need to have some degree of sensation. Even a book , an article , a conversation - they all must have something that was previously hidden to you. Or was purposefully kept hidden from you. 

> We seek what is hidden. 

In fact, you are reading this because you think you are seeking the truth and you believe TRUTH is hidden from you. 

# Spoilers Alert 

If you been on social media - Reddit in particular where they indulge into deep analysis :-) of movies , they put a "Spoilers Alert" for the new popular ones. So that you don't accidentally come to realize the climax . So that you don't miss the excitement of discovery of the hidden. What if you go to watch the movie not for the story or the climax but for the craft of making a movie - do you think spoilers will ever hinder you from watching? In fact there are very many movies that you re-watch , again and again - why ? Because they take you on a journey. You are now interested to check how they were made ? Who made them , who acted in those movies and what exactly is being said beyond the obvious story line. The obvious now becomes unimportant - you are seeking a higher purpose , your own interpretation - you see such movies as part of what defines "you" and the beauty is - that part is unknown to you. You can't express it. It can't be communicated. You have started decrypting knowledge out of the movie that you watch again and again - No worries about spoilers. Just the action of watching it again always throws in a new piece of knowledge. A piece of knowledge that was hidden to you thus far. 

> So here is the spoilers alert of this section of this book - there is nothing that you need to seek . Because the truth is one that is already known to you. The thing that is NOT hidden is the TRUTH. 

The question really is - is there anything that is NOT at all hidden from you ? That you know for sure. That doesn't make you go through two a two hours long hustle to revel itself ? I am sure there are many things. How do you know them ? One obvious answer is "you can do them" . Can you cook something ? Can you write a poem ? Can you breathe ? The solid things - things not left to a chance or hope. Those actions are the truth. 

> "Action" - being able to do something, is a living proof of the knowledge. That's is what makes "Actions" and "Knowledge" connected at the hips. In essence knowledge transcends into "Actions". 

# Orientation - `Aasakti` v/s 'Virakti"

Let us take this argument a bit further. What if you say that "watching the thriller" is also an action that you know how  to do. You know
how to click on Netflix icon. And select a movie to play ( btw selecting a movie on Netflix is arduous).  Fair enough. You are a Netflix Expert :-). 

The question then is - what are you watching this movie for - for the story or for the craft ? Are you envisaging a career in production? Are you trying to get some inspiration from the movie you are watching ? Or you may be a critic who is going to write a review on the movie. In such case the story doesn't matter. In fact a bad movie too is as much a lesson as a block buster because a bad manifestation teaches you what not to do. Gita says such a person , who  is looking at the thing objectively - for what it is worth - is the one who sees the truth and is called `Virakta`.

If you are seeking the story then you are chasing something that is hidden in the narrative. If it gave you a bigger surprise it is a good movie. Else it was a waste of two hours and you move on to the next best rotten tomato. If you see yourself in this category , then you are opposite of `Virakta` . Such a person is called `Aasakta`. Such person is driven by the desire of sensory consumption of manifestations. They are not using the manifestation (in this case) for inspiration. 

The example of a movie or a book is easier to comprehend. You can easily tell if you are seeking inspiration or are you seeking the sensory pleasure. Important thing to know is seekers of inspiration are as eager (or enthusiastic) as the seekers of pleasure. So you can't tell looking at someone else as to what their motivation is. But you sure can tell about yourself. You know what you are looking for .......but what if we made it little harder. 

> Instead of you watching the movie , if we make you a character in the movie ?


## Game vs a Book

A book is essentially a "single player game". A game on the other hand was supposed to be a multi player thing till the video games showed up and now with proliferation of internet, the video games have again turned back into the multi player games. Nevertheless , for the sake of this metaphor, the game is a "multi player" call of Duty. 

A single player game is easy to analyse because you can easily decipher as to what is your motivation. A multi player game gets  bit harder - for one it is more immersive and second it brings ton of other emotions - for example competition and recognition - the notion of a  win or a loss. Even in a book - try adding a villain. Most of the epics that turn your brain inside out are narratives of many many characters. Characters that look life like. A great book entangles your brain in such a way that you become a part of the mult-player narrative and you know what a roller coaster it is. 

> What if the game you are playing is "Reality"?

## Competition 

Competition seems to be the key driver of our modern reality. Competition is exponential by nature. Two people start a game, if it catches on, more and more players join in. Rewards become richer. People start drawing pleasure just by watching other people compete. Why do you think you go watch a soccer game ? I mean if we need to explain the soccer mania to an alien civilization, It will be hard to put in words as to  why more than a billion people obsess over bunch of players striving to push a ball into a goal post. What purpose ? Why Nations label their teams with their colors and flags ? These days, younger generation is watching others play even the video games . I was told never to venture into "Twitch" - it is addictive :-) 

The point is, once competition start, it grows exponentially. The logic , the purpose and the rationale takes a back seat. Krishna calls it `Spriha`. 

It is hard to understand your own motivations - `Aaskti or Virakti` even in a simple game ; imagine the plight of player caught into the competition - `Spriha`. When you are competing, there is no way to control the bugs. Desires, Anger, Greed , Delusions fire up the competition. This is the place for Matrix - `Maya` to become a score keeper. Matrix tracks your dollars , number of shoes in your closet, ties and fur coats in your ward robe. And yes , the best way to spark a competition with your neighbor is to park a Tesla Model S in your driveway :-)

On the other hand , a `Virakta` loves to stay in solitude ` Ekanata`. Away from the game . Always lost in the "Actions" and always ever in peace. Such a person is called `Udaseen` - some one who is not interested to play the exponential game. Who thinks soccer is fun for the players but it is essentially twenty odd youngsters trying to somehow sweat out their excess energy. Nothing more. He takes the narrative for what it is worth. No decorative flowery words. No cheer leading. Krishna says being `Udaseen` is a pre-requisite for controlling Curiosity `Mana` and Intelligence `Chitta` and thus getting to a stage of stable intelligence `Buddhiyoga` and becoming `Sthit Prajna`. 

## Organization 

Let us continue with the metaphor of soccer game. I had loved to use the "Cricket" as my analogy but arguably Soccer is bigger than Cricket. 

The game was simple. Twenty young players competing to post a ball through a goal and in the process sweating out excess energy. It is good to be fit. Even better to build camaraderie. But what is this multi-billion dollar business around this simple game ? We have clubs buying players, stadiums that can fit thousands of people to watch who incidently pay hefty amounts to grab the front seats , the telecast rights. Can you believe more than a billion people watch the soccer world cup final or for that matter soccer in Olympics. Under the banner of "higher , faster and better" ; we have built a multi billion dollar industry. 

All this is the exponent of competition. It fuels the competition. Underlying this is our ability to "Organize". Though it is quite a task  to explain this massive organization around a "simple" game to an alien ; to us it seems natural. It is in everything - countries , businesses , religions. We take very simple ideas and organize around them to essentially keep us away from our `Yajna`. 

## Religion

A point comes when the simple game is turned into a gamble. Bookers can gamify anything. Soccer, cricket, stocks , political outcomes - even art. Players in this new game have nothing to do with the underlying game. They have probably never even played it. In fact most of us have retirement accounts. We are already investing in equity market. Most of the players in securities market have never built a business let alone taking that business to the public offering. Such people, having lost touch with the underlying game, view this new game as religion. They are totally focused on outcomes. They change their slots in hope of jackpots. Going to different temples to find the cure is not very different from keep on changing your portfolio in expectation of higher return. We pray different lords in hope of promotions - at work or outside. 

This is not as simple as reading the book now. We are in a game of epic exponent. So much so that underlying Truth and even our motivations are hidden to us. 

Welcome to the "Race". 

## War

The race has just started. 

Religion is not only Hinduism or Islam or Christianity. Most of the well run organizations turn into religion. Apple is as much a religion as Buddhism. The reason is simple. The underlying game is hidden. No one knows what Apple is building - a car or a space ship ? Just like most of the Hindus haven't read Gita. But millions of people survive on Hinduism just like most of us have at least  ten percent of our portfolio in Apple. For such people, Hinduism must survive at the expense of any other entity - it doesn't matter if other entity is a country or a business or other so called "religion". Because all of them have the same fundamental architecture. A simple game that went super nova and formed a massive organization and then lost touch with the underlying simple game. The outcomes of this secondary game are beyond anyone's control. Players only adjust their actions in hope for a favorable outcome while surrendering their survival to secondary game. This is how  Religion turns into a cult. The core group of followers think their secondary game is the best because of their vested interest in the growth of their "religion". Everyone else must subscribe to the secondary game they are playing - Android is better than iOS ; Mac wins Windows ; Tesla v/s the Fossil Fuels ; Dems v/s Pubs; America vs Islam ; Palestine v/s Israel ; China v/s Free Speech ; Cryptos v/s Fiat  - The war is endless. 

### Redefining Survival

It is as much at work place as at home and even with in us. Where ever we lose the touch with underlying Truth , Matrix ` Maya` can gamify the exponential expanse and have the players of this secondary game fight for survival endlessly. Survival in the game becomes "REAL" survival. 

### Unpredictable 
The thing about this secondary game (created out of fluff ) is the outcomes are purely random. Bigger the game more random they are. In fact , they say "Cricket" is a game of chance. Means the moment you add more players (even in the basic game), the predictability suffers. You can't predict how the simple game of Soccer would shape up. Even super computers can't guesstimate the outcome. Well yes , you can say Maradona had a hand of God. Good players , place , weather - but you know , best of critics have failed the predictions even in a two players game such as "Chess" . Imagine someone trying to predict the stock market or the elections .. 

Krishna says - you can't escape this war - `Yudha`. But his description of war is little different ..

## Frame and Facade
With in any such organization , for example - political - where the new currency is "Control" rather than serving the people ; religious - where most of the constituents are seeking survival rather than truth ; Business - where mission is growth (market cap) rather than innovation ; there are always unorganized constituent who want to seek the underlying game. These `Virakta` want to see the game for what it is worth. They question the legitimacy of exponential expansion. Such people - though quiet, pose  quite a challenge to the stakeholders of secondary market. Such outliers can call a spade a spade. They can reveal the TRUTH that it is just twenty odd youngsters sweating out their excess. Such people must be weeded out because they pose a higher risk than the other external secondary games. 

This is the war with in. The rebellion. It again occurs at every level. The best way to control this rebellion is to frame the population in "exit fear" and build a facade of fictitious higher purpose in the secondary market. You have heard the term "walled gardens". Facebook's stated mission is about "connecting people" - facade ; and the exit fear is you will lose touch with your network. As if there was no network before Facebook. As if people were all disconnected. You can find such rosy statements all around secondary markets. 

So the clamp is closed. On one side you are driven by desire to survive on the other side you are famed into fear of exit. And to misguide your motivation , you are given a rosy , uplifting slogan. Krishna says this the  `Bhrama`. Maya creates `Bhrama` in individuals such that they are blinded to their own motivations. 

There is no way to physically fight this war because more you "physically" fight , more you are entangled in the game. 

> This war is with in us though it manifests into everything we are engaged in. It is not about my country or my religion or my technology. It is about my orientation. It is about revealing the Truth that got hidden in the expanse of the Matrix. 

[TEST] The question really is how do you determine if you are seeking Truth (the hidden in this case) ; You need to check your motivations - `Virakta` v/s `Aaskta`. Do you see things for what they are worth ? Are you surviving on the secondary market ? Are you fighting for the cult or are you a lone warrior , Are you advocating your technology  as better than mine ? Do you think soccer is game or do you believe it is a religion ?

# The Spin 

Now that we a handle on the two basic orientations - one that focuses on the core of the game and seeks to act `Virakta` and the other that expands the exponential fluff and seeks to survive in it - `Aasakta` ; It is a common mistake to perceive them as a straight line with two opposite arrows. Instead try  to visualise them as a single spin. 

![spin](spin.jpg)

## Energy for the actions

We talked about "Knowledge" and "Actions" tied at the hip. In the hypothesis, we said that [protected] knowledge is the source and energy of all the "Action". Think of this "spin" as the energy. 

> Every being has a unique stable spin. This is called the `svabhava` - the nature of the manifestation. Think of it as a sum total of all the internal manifestations such as heart beat to our ability to digest the food. 

Krishna says your `Svabhava` will anyway force you into your natural actions even if you try to abandon them. `Aaskati` defocuses you from your `Svabhava` to the things you are chasing for. `Virakti` (or `Anaskti`) brings your focus back so that you can attain your natural equilibrium. 

Krishna's Chakra has 108 edges symbolizing internal manifestations. These internal manifestations  are also called - `Vrittis`. In common `Hath Yoga` Practices of `Tantra` , the `Vrittis` are controlled by the `Chakras`. Each `Chakra` is identified by a lotus with as many petals as many `Vrittis` it controls.  For example the six petals of `Swathishthana` chakra represent the `Vrittis`: affection, pitilessness, feeling of all-destructiveness, delusion, disdain, and suspicion.  The petals of `Manipura Chakra` correspond to the `Vrittis` of spiritual ignorance, thirst, jealousy, treachery, shame, fear, disgust, delusion, foolishness and sadness. 

The five main `Chakras` along the spinal chord also control the five elements - Fire , Air , Water etc.. `Hath Yoga` is a practice to control these `Chakras` to enable the energy flow through all your body. 

Think of above said `Vrittis` as the fundamental games that are foundation to our consciousness and cumulate into our natural spin speed - the `svabhava`. The code for all these `Vrittis` is said to be rooted in the lowest `Chakra` named `Mooladhara`. A yogi resolves these games (puzzles) by controlling something called `Kundalini`. 

Krishna says , " Many sages try to understand `Atma` - the protected knowledge through Pure Meditation or  `Tantra` - Breathing patterns - `Pranayama` and `Mudras` - body postures held up in positions to control the energy flow. He adds -   the easiest way ,however, is to stay stable in mind and intellect and focus on righteous actions that are based on your `svabhava` because the actionable knowledge and energy for such basic games is already built in to you. He further adds ` Karm Yoga` is thus most effective way to attain peace and is accessible to every one for it's simplicity.

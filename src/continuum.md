Krishna said in verse 27 of chapter 2 that all things born in truth must die and out of the death in truth comes life. This kinda hints at the cyclic reality of our being. In previous article, where we hypothesised the postulates of Gita , we went through a numbered list that we are all endowed with a protected, immutable but encrypted copy of knowledge. We also dwelled on the idea that `Bramh` - an overarching  system, provisions everything - our "tiny box". In addition, it also implements a superior garbage collection system. But we left an important point open that the  underlying reality is a continuum. There is no beginning or an end. It's an everlasting cycle of knowledge to manifestation and vice-versa. This cycle is also called `Kaal Chakra` - the cycle of "Time". Each cycle expresses a specific aspect of "Knowledge". These cycles of Time are scale invariant - i.e they may express an entire Universe or a single atom or even a quark inside an atom. The journey of human life or for that matter any other manifestation is thus too a cycle of Time. 

# Time

One of the reason it is so hard to understand time is we treat time as a measure. For example an year is a duration it takes earth to go around the sun. A day is earth's spin around its own axis. The problem is such measures work for spatial dimensions such as length , width or depth because when I am using a meter scale , I can tell that a tree is ten meter tall as a whole. I can see the starting point of the measure and the end. But if I use a day as a measure of time , I have no way to tell if a particular thing is 200 days. I can't see the starting point when I am taking the measure on say 200th day. In other words we can say that a building is ten meters high. I can prove it you by taking a meter rod and measuring it right there , but there is no easy way to tell if the building is exactly ten years old. And even if we have a way to tell that building is actually ten years old , we don't know for sure how long this building is going to last. A ten meter high building is supposed to stay ten meter high but it is not guaranteed that building is going to be ten years old or going to last for 100 years. In other words - Time is not a spatial measure. A spatial measure is where both start and end of the measurement are in the same moment whereas time is something across many moments. In a way time is orthogonal to space. So hereon , we shall represent Time as perpendicular to space. 

You may say if a road is 1000 miles long , we can't see the starting point. I agree but we can have someone stand there and claim that the start of road still exist when we measure 1000th mile. Can we do this with time ? The start and the end of the road exist at the same moment of the measurement but time in itself is a measure of moments. The fact that start and end of time are NOT in the same moment, makes it almost impossible to visualize even with our most advanced instruments. If a say a building is 100 years old , I just can't have someone sitting in 1922 telling me that yes the building actually came up  there in 1922. I need to depend on the history. And assuming building records were maintained correctly , I may conclude building is 100 years old. 

> So we can say that the first law of Time is :-)   Time is the historical data of events. Time only makes sense if we have a history. 

## Information

The good news is nature provides a mechanism to maintain history for everything. This mechanism is a fool proof ledger that can't be tempered by anyone. No it is not a Block Chain :-) It is called "light". We may also cal it "information". 

Everything that exists or ever existed, emits electromagnetic radiations (with exception of Black holes- they swoop in their own radiations too - they are both hungry and greedy). These radiations can be in different levels of energy (or frequency). For example Gamma rays have very high energy even more than X rays. On the other side of spectrum we have radio waves that have a very high wave-length and thus very low energy. Our visible light falls somewhere in the middle. There is however one thing in common for all the electro-magnetic waves - they all travel at the same speed in our space - roughly at around 300,000 km per sec. I can go "on and on" on electro-magnetic waves but I had rather give you this xkcd - it says it all.

![](./spectrum.jpg)


Scientists use these waves to measure all sorts of things from the far flung places to the origin of our universe. For example , our Universe is 13.8 billion years old. Obviously there was no recorded history at that time. Then how can we be so sure of the phenomenon? That is where electromagnetic waves come into play - We know that we can still observe the light created say around 380,000 years after the big bang. The photons from that event are still accessible to our instruments. This back ground light is distinctly available in the shape of microwave radiations commonly called "cosmic microwave radiations -CMB" . We can figure out with high confidence that the pattern of CMB is around 380,000 years after the big bang. 

The first question is how come these photons still around?  From theory of Relativity, we know that everything moves at ~300K km per sec in our space-time. And that includes you , me and the computer you are reading  this text on. If something moves spatially at the speed of light ~300K Km per sec, then it doesn't move at all in time and -vice versa. In other words ~300K Km per sec in not a special thing for "light". The only thing that is special about light is it puts all its eggs into the spatial basket whereas we the "chair-seekers" move mostly in time :-)  

Thus photons never move in time. They are ever young. Or in other words - nothing ever dies in the realm of information. 

>> Health Tip - If you wanna stay young , kick the chair and start running around. Faster you move in space, younger you are going to be :-) You may not save much in terms of your motion in time but running around anyways keeps the muscles strong !


![](./circleOfC.jpg)

*The figure above ignores the gravity to simplify the things . We know gravity bends the space-time and thus the diagram becomes bit convoluted instead of a nice looking circle if we consider the effects of gravity*


Since Photons move at the speed of light (C) in space, they don't move at all in time. In other words the photons created 380,000 years after the big bang are still available to our instruments. These photons are exactly in the same conditions as they were at the time of their birth and they are traveling in space at ~300K Km per second and are reaching us from all the directions. We can go in details as to why is the CMB visible in all the directions but that is not the point. The point is -  it is generally understood that light emitted from the past events can reach us now . For example the light that is coming to us from sun left sun around 8 minutes back but it didn't change at all in these last 8 minutes. In essence photons don't age at all. The one that left billions of years ago from the face of some star is still the same. Or we can say information moves at the speed of light in space. It doesn't contribute at all any of its motion towards time. 

> This brings us to our second law of Time - Time is for only those things that exist. Or have some mass because only things with some mass can produce electromagnetic waves. In other words only manifested things experience time. Information, on the other hand,  is timeless because photons are massless.

> This kinda makes sense and plays well with  our first law because you can record history of only those things that exist. If something never existed, there is no history for it. We sure can wait for it to happen but its history will start only after it happened. 

**And here goes first paradox of Time. You see , there is no fun in science if there are no paradoxes :-)**

### Wave Particle Duality

The question is - if Photons don't move at all in time, then how do we get the light from our extreme past ? Even from near past? Things don't add up here ! If something doesn't move at all in time , then it should be stuck in the same moment. It should never reach future ! This is where the Nobel prize winning idea of Einstein comes up. Einstein showed that even information must manifest in order to pass through time. Okay , he didn't put it like this but he did prove the wave-particle duality of light. Just as a side note - Einstein won Nobel prize for describing the wave particle nature of light (photo-electric effect) NOT for theory of relativity. At the first look it appears gross negligence on the part of Nobel jury but if you dig deeper, the idea of wave particle duality is core of understanding time. Let us see how ?

![](cycleOfTime.jpg)

The graphic above explains the iterations of a Photon through space and time . Through space as information and through time as a particle. The horizontal lines represent say a moment in time. To move through time - photons must manifest themselves as a particle and then again into massless information. This life-cycle is ephemeral. Photons transform into mass and then back to wave at incredibly fast rate. Despite the extra ordinary speed of their transitions - there is still a finite speed limit . And that speed translates into a "space-time" velocity of ~300 K Km per sec. If you notice, I am saying **space-time** , Not space - why ? Because the notion is velocity itself brings in the time - velocity is expressed in terms of "per second" or "per hour" - an arbitrary unit of time - which means any statement of velocity is essentially a statement pertaining to space time. Or in other words - we can't measure velocity in absolute space without throwing in a "time" aspect.

In the light of this discussion, you may want to take another look at the circular graph now. It is a graph of velocity "C". The idea that we may split the motion in absolute space or absolute time breaks down the very notion of "velocity". In other words, the moment something manifests (including photons) the time starts ticking. In a way, time and space are inseparable. Even if we hypothetically assume something at absolute rest, it is still moving in time. Thus motion is the fundamental aspect of all manifested objects. In a way , motion itself is the history. 

The key point is this duality of wave to particle and back to wave may also be called mass-information duality. In essence every manifested thing is a representation of information. And information can also be expressed as mass. 

We got some idea that manifested things pass on information through electromagnetic waves. How and why they do it is something we can park for now because the bigger  question is how does information turns into mass ?


### Mass

It was Maxwell who postulated that in order for electro magnetic waves to pass, there must be a field. This field is called electro magnetic field. We will go into details of electro-magnetic fields, when we discuss about the "consciousness" later in this book. Suffice to say here, that electro-magnetic field is kind of a template that allow the passage of a photon in space-time. It allows photon to act like a wave and also act like a particle. It must do both cuz we don't want information stuck in a moment for ever. Einstein built heavily on Maxwell's ideas to derive wave-particle duality and later these ideas paved the way for Special as well General Theory of Relativity. All good except that GR has crazy math. Life loving humans are NOT supposed to understand these equations. That exactly is the reason that even after more than 100 years of GR , the theory is well understood by only a special breed of humans who actually believe that space-time is curved :-) Last I checked , it was still flat :-) 

Anyways - jokes apart GR still remains a wonder of creative thinking and hardcore math and I am okay to think that there is an actual electro-magnetic field out there wherever the light goes - which is literally our entire observable universe and we can easily speculate that unobservable universe too has light and thus elecro-magnetic field. In a way entire space - even the so called empty space - has "intelligence" built into it to enable traversal of information through time through cycles of manifestation and information.

Now this is a big ask. We are asking every one to assume that there is this electro-magnetic field that underlies our entire universe. This electromagnetic field holds the keys for light to behave as a wave and as a particle. If you don't believe in this pre given "intelligence" of space , I fully agree with you. This can be an accident. Just a random property of space. It can just be a chance.

However things didn't stop here. After General Theory of Relativity, our best theory is "Quantum Field Theory - QFT" . I say "best" because both GR and QFT are testable by experiments. Many more theories are beautiful from mathematics standpoint but they are beyond our current state of observation (for example String Theory).

With QFT, we now have testable proof that every basic sub-atomic particle has their own fields. Depending on who you ask this question , quantum specialists will tell you there are anywhere between 19 to 268 such fields that give rise to electrons, quarks and a truck load of other basic sub atomic particles. And all these fields are stacked together, many of them non interfering with each other , all across the universe. 

At the risk of totally alienating you , I am quoting here-below this [answer](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/176941/how-many-quantum-fields-are-there) from Physics stack exchange. You can totally skip over it but you will see after this quote as to why it was important to put it here ..

<blockquote>
The Standard Model of particle physics is the current well established theory for elementary particles. In it, fields are grouped together using symmetries (Lorentz and gauge) in what are called multiplets. Because of it, it is not clear how to count the number of quantum fields there are in it.

For example, we can count for each multiplet how many real degrees of freedom it has. The counting goes as follows (don't worry if you don't understand some of the words, they're just ways of stating how the symmetries act on the multiplet; d.o.f means "degrees of freedom"):

- Complex scalars:
  - Higgs doublet: SU(2) doublet, 4 d.o.f.

- Two-component spinors:
    - Right-handed electron (3 flavors): singlet, 4 d.o.f. 
    - Right-handed up quarks (3 flavors): color-triplet, 12 d.o.f. 
    - Right-handed down quarks (3 flavors): color-triplet, 12 d.o.f. 
    - Left-handed lepton doublet (3 flavors): SU(2)-doublet, 8 d.o.f. 
    - Left-handed quark doublet (3 flavors): color-triplet SU(2)-doublet, 36 d.o.f.

- Massless complex vectors:
    - U(1)Y gauge boson: singlet, 4 d.o.f.
    - SU(2) gauge boson: SU(2)-triplet, 12 d.o.f.
    - Gluon: color-octet, 32 d.o.f.

So there are 19 multiplets and if we decompose them we get 268 real fields.
</blockquote>

And we are only talking about the basic particles here. No one has any clue how these complex fields interact with each other to build conscious objects such as humans. 

 I guess there should be a better way to organize these ideas ..

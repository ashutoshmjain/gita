`Anyaay` means injustice.

Good and evil co-exist in the present — in every moment, in every interaction. They are literally the two sides of a coin. Everything in this world may be seen as "Good" and the same from a different vantage may be seen as "evil". This is what underpins the cyclic nature of our tiny box — the dualistic nature of our being. 

The question is how to ascertain what is "good", and consequently, what is "evil" ? The determination is individualistic but it is very simple. Assume you are visiting your friend's home. You follow the rules of her house. You act, exactly, in line with what is suggested as the norm of the house. You eat what her mother made. You play with games that her father bought for her. You act satisfied even if the games are not as rich as you have in your home. You behave in line with what the tiny box (your friend's home) wanted you. You still had fun, and your friend too. 

What if you start changing that home based on what you think is right for you. Now you are acting based on your desires. You want to change the reality to fulfill your random desires - small or big. What do you think will happen. Even if your friend accommodate you, her mother or her father may not. If they all caution you to follow the rules, you might cease to have fun because you want reality altered to meet your desires.

Must I say, what is a good behavior, and what is evil. Altering reality of your friend's home just to satisfy your desires seems an obvious evil behaviour. What if we deem the entire universe that we observe around us, a friend's home. What if we seek and clarify the rules or expectations of the reality around us - our tiny box, and act exactly as per the expectations. No one stopped us from having fun. In fact everyone is pleased if you have fun with in the rules of your tiny box. Your actions, aligned with the physical reality, are `Karma`. And your behaviour aligned with the physical reality is called `Dharma`. There are rules even to alter the reality that are well accepted. But ignoring the rules, just to meet your desires is not acceptable. That is what evil is. Evil is born out of uncontrolled desires ! Desires for longer life, desires for wealth, desires for recognition, desire for pleasures — desires are endless. 

`Anyaay` — Injustice happens when we, owing to our uncontrolled desires, harm someone else — take someone's rightful, to satisfy our unreasonable. The important thing is how do we define "rightful". That is the key and biggest cause of confusion. The rightful is determined by our "tiny box" , our physical reality. Since everyone has a unique tiny-box, forcing a universal definition of "rightful" is also unjust.

In most of the cases, the equations of good and evil balance out. They do in the tiniest moment and they obviously do so in the eternity. They balance out on individual level as well as for the entire population. The balance endows perpetuity to our universe - `Bramha`. But once in a long while - evil may overpower the good. How to balance such an event ? That was the question that `Dwaipayana` had no answer to. Only `Bramha` ( through it's manifestative property) could reveal the answer, for no human , not even the divine writer could speculate such a pre-meditated balancing act of nature. What seems like a reasonable hypothesis, still needs a proof. A proof is what actually happens in the physical reality. Proof is truth.

He writes in `Gita` that `Vishnu` himself told this secret. His seventh incarnation, also named `Krishna` tells `Arjuna` in the middle of battle field.

Only when the evil crosses human capacity to launch a legit response, `Vishnu` must incarnate to restore the order. He must show, by example, the "code of conduct" in most difficult situations. 

The point, however, was, should `Dwaipayana` accept the word of God just because he said so? Or God must show the proof in physical reality! 

# Anyaay ...

With the massacre of that fateful morning when every one in `Vasishtha's` congregation was killed for no apparent reason, `Maharishi` thought `Mathura` had seen it's share of injustice. And he believed, justice was served through his fire traps. As able as he was, in ability to see the past, observe the present, and forecast the future; he couldn't be more wrong ; for the biggest act of injustice was still to happen. That too in in his back yard, `Mathura`. Time had come to witness the free fall of human values — the very erosion of kindness. 

Time has also come to catch on the story of `Kansa` that I promised in previous chapters. Evil had made `Kansa` it's vehicle to serve the ultimate injustice — something that was impossible to be balanced even by compassion of `Maharishi`.

Most people brushed the prophesy aside as a ploy of `Kansa` to keep `Vasudev` in house arrest. Few , who believed in such things thought that it is somewhere long in the future. It had take couple of decades for `Devki` to deliver eighth child who the prophesy suggested would kill `Kansa`.  Who knows it would ever happen and who knows what had be the power equation then. `Vasudev` , `Devki` or even `Kansa` could die. Their minds might change to find lost love between the brother and sister. There were numerous possibilities. 

`Vasudev` and `Devki` themself didn't think there was any danger to their expected child. The first one of their wedlock and sign of their love through thick and thin.

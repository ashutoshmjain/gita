# Prologue

`Krishna Dvaipayana` was brought to life for a purpose. He was destined to compile and rearrange thousands of sacred insights, new and old, from sages (`Rishies`) and super sages (`Maharishies`). He crystallized, then existing, entire wisdom into four foundational volumes — the `Vedas`. For this legendary work, he was conferred the most coveted title in literature — `Ved Vyasa` (the chief editor of Vedas). This work, in itself, was virtuous enough to dedicate a life-time; however, his real goal was even bigger! The immensity of his purpose, rightfully so, made him one of the immortal-eights [^immortals] in Hindu tradition. 

`Krishna's` literary work was no accident. He came from a lineage of scholarly sages. His father `Maharishi Parāśara` spoke titles such as `Brihat Parāśara Hora` — foundational work on Astrology; `Krishi Parāśara` — his insights on Agriculture;  `Vrkayurveda` — the first book on botany, and `Vishnu Purana`[^vishnu] — the manifestative potency of the knowledge. His grand father `Sakti Muni`, was the first to understand `Karm Yoga` . And his great grand father `Vasishtha` was titled `Bramh`[^bramh]`-rishi` (The keeper of eternal knowledge). It feels like `Krishna's` lineage predetermined his destiny — as if someone planned a multi-generational project to bring `Vedas` to written word.

Not only did `Krishna` edit the four Vedas, he also scribed eighteen `Puranas` and wrote the master piece `Jaya` (victory)  — a historical narrative that included the story of Lord Sri `Krsna`[^krsna] and `Arjuna`, among thousands of other histories, presented in a narrative format. All of them meshed up like a knowledge graph - intricately interwoven, yet able to stand alone separately. 

`Jaya` was later expanded into a mega-epic, `Mahabharata`, his familial memoir - spanning his own and next two generations. `Mahabharata`, with around 1.8 million words, is the longest written poetic collection ever, in any language, old or new. To put it in perspective, it is about ten times the size of Iliad and Odyssey combined. 

More than the size, the quality of poetry is such that it inspired `Kalidasa` — commonly known as Shakespeare of Sanskrit — to write `Abhijnana Shakuntalam`. In fact, `Shakuntalam` is a rewrite of the plot first conceived by `Krishna` in `Mahabharata`. 

In addition to the poetic excellence, `Mahabharata` defined a new way of life — action orientation (`Karm Yoga`). The epic forms to-date, the cultural basis of one of the oldest civilization — India. It holds within it, center-folded, the gist of four Vedas — `Bhagvat Gita` — the first written source of the idea of `Karma` without desires.

**The question is, how did `Krishna` manage to write such epics at a time when scribing , in itself, was a major challenge? — there was no spell check, no grammar support! In fact, Sanskrit Grammar [^panini] was not even formalized yet. And of-course there was no computer. Not even a type-writer!**

The legend says,` Krishna` invoked `Bramha`(`Bramh` in human form) to seek help in scribing `Mahabharata`. `Bramha`, in his infinite wisdom, advised him to reach out to `Siva`[^siva],  for his son `Ganesa`[^ganesa] (the elephant God) possessed the superior intelligence to scribe such a vast body of work.

`Adi Parva` the first book of `Mahabharata` describes this story in all it's poet glory. Translated by `Kisari Mohan Ganguly` , here is an excerpt -

> The son of Satyavati having, by penance and meditation, analysed the eternal Veda, afterwards composed this holy history, when that learned Brahmarshi of strict vows, the noble Dwaipayana Vyasa, offspring of Parasara, had finished this greatest of narrations, he began to consider how he might teach it to his disciples. 
>
> And the possessor of the six attributes, Brahma, the world's preceptor, knowing of the anxiety of the Rishi Dwaipayana, came in person to the place where the latter was, for gratifying the saint, and benefiting the people. 
>
> And when Vyasa, surrounded by all the tribes of Munis, saw him, he was surprised; and, standing with joined palms, he bowed and ordered a seat to be brought. 
>
> And Vyasa having gone round him who is called Hiranyagarbha seated on that distinguished seat, stood near it; 
>
> and being commanded by Brahma Parameshthi, he sat down near the seat, full of affection and smiling in joy. 
> 
> Then the greatly glorious Vyasa, addressing Brahma Parameshthi, said, 
>
> "O divine Brahma, by me a poem hath been composed which is greatly respected.  The mystery of the Veda, and what other subjects have been explained by me; 
>
> - the various rituals of the Upanishadas with the Angas; 
>
> - the compilation of the Puranas and history formed by me and named after the three divisions of time, past, present, and future; 
>
> - the determination of the nature of decay, fear, disease, existence, and non-existence, a description of creeds and of the various modes of life; 
>
> - rule for the four castes, and the import of all the Puranas; 
> 
> - an account of asceticism and of the duties of a religious student; 
>
> - the dimensions of the sun and moon, the planets, constellations, and stars, together with the duration of the four ages; 
>
> - the Rik, Sama and Yajur Vedas; 
>
> - also the Adhyatma; 
>
> - the sciences called Nyaya, Orthoephy and Treatment of diseases; 
>
> - charity and Pasupatadharma; 
>
> - birth celestial and human, for particular purposes; 
>
> - also a description of places of pilgrimage and other holy places of rivers, mountains, forests, the ocean, of heavenly cities and the kalpas; 
>
> - the art of war; 
>
> - the different kinds of nations and languages: 
>
> - the nature of the manners of the people; 
>
> - and the all-pervading spirit;
>
> all these have been represented. But, after all, no writer of this work is to be found on earth.'
>
>"Brahma said. 
> 
> 'I esteem thee for thy knowledge of divine mysteries, before the whole body of celebrated Munis distinguished for the sanctity of their lives. 
>
> I know thou hast revealed the divine word, even from its first utterance, in the language of truth. 
>
> Thou hast called thy present work a poem, wherefore it shall be a poem. 
>
> There shall be no poets whose works may equal the descriptions of this poem, even, as the three other modes called Asrama are ever unequal in merit to the domestic Asrama. 
>
> Let Ganesa be thought of, O Muni, for the purpose of writing the poem.' 


Having approached by `Krishna` and advised by his father `Siva`, `Ganesa` — the embodiment of ‘intelligence’, told `Krishna`, he was willing to help, but he would stop writing if `Krishna` paused even for a moment. He probably deemed there was no time to waste, given the immensity of the work to be scribed.  `Krishna` agreed, but he (tactfully) added, `Ganesa` must scribe a verse only after fully understanding the intent, because text was meant for a human mind![^humanMind]

>"Ganesa, upon hearing this address, thus answered, 
>
>'I will become the writer of thy work, provided my pen do not for a moment cease writing." 
>
> And Vyasa said unto that divinity, 
>
> 'Wherever there be anything thou dost not comprehend, cease to continue writing.' 
>
> Ganesa having signified his assent, by repeating the word Om! proceeded to write; 
>
> and Vyasa began; 
>
> and by way of diversion, he knit the knots of composition exceeding close; 
>
> by doing which, he dictated this work according to his engagement.


It was the tipping point, when humanity embraced a new medium for the knowledge — text - for communication and preservation.


# A `Writing` Revolution


`Mathura` was the geographic center of `Bharata` — old India. It was also the center of mass adoption of `written-word`.


`Mahabharta` was scribed in eighteen `Parvas` (books). Not only the longest poem, it was the first major narrative written down in text. Even if it wasn't a divine intervention, scribing such an immense scripture at that time, was no less than a divine grace. And `Vyasa` made a crucial point — narrating a scripture this complex to the masses, was almost impossible unless it was scribed first into written words. 


![mathuraLanding](./mathuraLanding.png)

‘Text’ was the new medium. It was somewhat similar to our migration from analog to digital. Not only did it demand new tools of scribing, it also meant the population must learn reading and writing, beyond a select class of sages and super sages - just the way we needed mass adoption of computers in early nineties and smart phones later. Superior intelligence `Ganesa` was invoked to usher the humanity into this new era, just the way we are using natural language processing in current digital realm. 

In a way, the ‘texting revolution’ was a bigger jump forward (than the digital internet), simply because we are talking thousands of years in the past. The legend says `Mahabharata` got to current state in over six hundred years. It was like the Wikipedia of that time. Every king, every invention of value, must find it's place in `Mahabharata`. There was an all around effort to reduce the cost while increasing the utility. 


It wasn't that no one knew scribing before, but the written word was pegged to the cave walls, just like murals and wall carvings. The early books adopted similar techniques. Books were written on a human size posters made with cotton canvas and framed in wood. Instead of chiseling, they used colors of `Henna`, to paint the messages. Paintings and books were essentially of the same measure and medium. A painter could afford to spend an year on a painting but spending that much effort on a single page of a scripture was hell of an effort. 

In an estimate, a hundred page long book, printed on human size frame back then, used to cost a gold [^gold] coin. The goal was to bring the cost down to a silver coin. And bring the size down to a tenth of the human size. An order of magnitude reduction in size and cost, paved the way for large scale adoption of written words to scribe the scriptures. Does it sound like a journey from mainframes to to the smartphone?

What were the challenges and motivations that led to this major step up in human cognition? Why would someone want to scribe the entire wisdom in a single narrative. And most importantly, how was this wisdom tested before putting into text! 

Following pages are a filtered version of my study and imagination investigating that revolution. And not surprisingly, it makes a fascinating story! And also a reflection on why humans keep changing the medium in pursuit to climb the ladder of consciousness! They also answer one question that stayed longer on my mind — why should I care? Why should any one care!. Turned out, our moral dilemmas are not very different from that time !

As we are moving to increasingly digital world (think VR), we are trying to take books into the new medium - digital copies in same size and format! Maybe we are trying to write books on human scale posters as our forefathers did ! Do we need another way to retain knowledge in digital world? Is that new format social media or is it Wikipedia? Or we still need to find a new home for the knowledge — an order of magnitude more efficient! As we go through the story of creation of `Maha-Bharata`, we will discover many such questions. I can't promise all the answers, but we may look at that first shift through the rear view mirror , to get a better vantage of our current struggles ..

Let me rewind you to around seven-ish thousands years back. It is about the time `Krishna's` father was to be born at `Mathura` — a major pilgrim destination now, the foremost seat of learning back then ... and a major mishap occurred — something never heard before — and something that triggered the **writing revolution.**

## reasech and notes:

[^immortals]:  In Hindu scriptures, there are frequent mentions of eight `Chiranjeevies`. The literal meaning is the one who lives for very long time such that they may be seen as immortals. Among them are Ved Vyasa, Parshu Rama, Ashwathama, Vibishana, Krupacharya, Hanumaan, Mahabali and Markandeya.

[^vishnu]: Spoken by `Maharishi Parasara`, `Vishnu Purana` was later scribed into text by his son `Krishna Dwaipayana`. `Purana` means the ancient stories. `Vishnu Purana` is thus ancient stories of `Vishnu` - One of the three primal forces of existence. In `Vaidik` framework of Indian mythology, God is not a person. It is a combination of three basic protocols. The protocol that turns knowledge into manifested conscious beings when certain conditions are met, is known as `Vishnu`. Each of the manifested being has a separate set of conditions required to manifest. In that, a mosquito is different from a snake. Hence, `Vishnu` is the collection of templates of creation. In his idol image, `Vishnu` is normally shown to bear the universal continuum `Chakra` on his finger. The incarnations of `Vishnu`, lead the life to higher state of consciousness. For example first incarnation of `Vishnu`, `Matsya Avtara` a fish, symbolizes the conscious growth when living beings moved from water to solid earth. His second incarnation was `Kurma` a turtle depicting the ability of conscious beings to stay and live long on Earth. The ten incarnations of `Vishnu` are called `Dashavataras` . They are compared to evolution; Kurma - the amphibian - is regarded the next stage after Matysa, the fish. Here is the detailed [evolutionary interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashavatara). It is important to mention that while all three have their respective representations in human form, only `Vishnu` may physically incarnate in human world. Obviously, because `Vishnu` is the science of manifestation. It must present reference examples. `Bramh` and `Siva` never incarnate in the physical world.

---

[^bramh]: The meta-physical mechanism that bears the knowledge in a connected network of conscious  beings, is known as `Bramh`. Think of `Bramh` as a knowledge field of a social graph. Just the way mass must co-exists with meta-physical electro-magnetic field, consciousness co-exists with a ‘knowledge field’. In a way, `Bramh` holds the entire knowledge , `Vishnu` turns this knowledge into manifestations as per the laws of nature (physics). The way photons are perceivable particle state of EM fields, ‘actions — `Karma`’ are the manifested nature of knowledge field.

---

[^krsna]: `Krasna` is eighth incarnation of `Vishnu`. Also called `Krishna` in north India in which case his name is same as the author of `Mahabharata` — `Krishna Dwaipaiyana`. In a way `Krsna` is the embodiment of `Krishna Dwaipayna's` knowledge such that only `Vishnu`, in his complete incarnation, could perform this role.

---

[^panini]: `Maha-Bharata` is believed to be before `Panini`, who first standardised the Sanskrit Grammar. `Panini's` grammar — `Ashtadhyayi` has references to `Maha-Bharata` that indicate that it was written much later.  And the flavor of Sanskrit is sure not same as that of `Panini`.  `Dwaipayana's` Sanskrit is called `Vaidik Sanskrit`.

---

[^siva]: Siva is the highest state of consciousness. Evolution of `Vishnu`, eventually reaches a state where ‘knowledge’ is absolute. This potency is thus, maintains the systems to support equilibrium of `Bramh`. In other words, `Siva` governs the knowledge field. `Siva` is thus seen as the one who keeps the knowledge current. These three protocols (`Bramh`, `Visnu` and `Siva`) are scale-invariant. They are omnipresent — from a subatomic particle to galaxies and beyond. While all three span the entire universe, only `Vishnu` is potent enough to incarnate.

---

[^ganesa]: `Ganesa` is the deity of intelligence. The legend says that `Ma Parvati` - wife of `Siva`, created a humanoid from her skin scrub. `Siva` unhappy with the limited intelligence of this humanoid (as he couldn't even contextualize that `Siva` was `Parvati's` husband), implanted an elephant head on him to invoke superior intelligence. An elephant has three times the number of neurons verses a human brain. To compare with current largest artificial intelligence systems, a human brain is around 300 times the size of largest neural networks of our time such as GPT3. Thus `Ganesa` had around 1000x natural(not artificial) intelligence verses the largest of our artificial intelligences! In Hindu tradition, it is considered auspicious to remember `Ganesa` at the initiation of any major project. He is known to be the biggest problem solver, obviously on account of his superior intelligence.

---

[^humanMind]: The idea of the joke is relevant even today. Despite our progress in artificial intelligence, our machines barely understand the human consciousness. For example , a computer may suggest synonyms but it is hard for computer to feel the emotions invoked by the choice of the words. `Krishna` meant that `Ganesa` being a humanoid, could be faster in word processing but he really need to understand the meaning of the words.

---

[^gold]: Barter system was still widespread for the smaller transactions. Commoners used fruits and grains to get what they needed. Rich people used copper as a store of value. A one time adult meal was normally considered one copper coin. So was a ride fare. You could hop on and hop off any boat or cart at any place along its route for one copper coin. Super rich used copper for utensils at their home. For them the valuable was silver. A silver coin was considered same as ten copper coins. One each for every single finger of two hands. Ultra rich ate their food in Silver utensils. For them store of value  was a Gold coin. A Gold coin was equal to ten Silver's. One for every finger of both the hands. The valuation was based on rough order of magnitude in mining these metals. Silver was considered ten times harder than copper, and Gold being an order of magnitude harder than Silver. In a way "proof of work" was baked in universally acceptable currency. All states, no matter what their political equations, honoured this simple "proof of work" based storage of value. Privacy , self custody and universality were the underpin of trading system. Nation states couldn't even imagine to start their own currencies ! Currency was pegged to people's trust in "proof of work". Important point to note here, currency was not pegged to commodities such as iron. Gold, silver and copper were NOT commodities. Gold's only purpose was ornaments , silver was used purely for minting, and copper was primarily used for making utensils for the rich. Copper was supposedly the best metal to store food and water. Eating in silver, though common for rich, was considered a show-off.This simple to understand and time tested system of power of ten, was later exploited by `Aryabhatta` to conceptualize zero and decimal system - the very basis of modern arithmetic.

# Triangulation

In trigonometry and geometry, triangulation is the process of determining the location of a point by forming triangles to the point from known points. {Wikipedia}

Let us try to find our position from the set of knowns. In fact we are search for the "truth" but truth is who we are ? The most importnat command in Unix world is `whiami`. If we want to understand "who we are" then we need to listen to our own noise. How my heart feels and how my mind reacts. 

Once we undertand who we are, then only we can plot where we want to go. Yoga is nothing but this path. The internal evolution from what you are to what you want to be is thus Yoga. Karm Yoga goes a step further. It says that you should aspire to be someone who fully understand and comprehend the situation at hand ; and acts righteously without expectations. In a way, such person does what this universal machine wants him to do. Diliverence of such responsibility also entails our ability to fully understand ourselves , our emotional response and an innate ability to keep a check on our nature while we are in pursuit of the task or duty at hand. Thus Karm Yoga encompasses all the yogas. And that also means why `Karm Yoga` is most misunderstood concept.

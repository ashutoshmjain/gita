# Chapter 12  
  
## Stanza 1: Verses 12-1 & 12-2  
Arjuna spake: Of those who worship Thee, O Lord,  
With constant heart, Thy manifest form adore,  
And those who seek the Unmanifest, unseen,  
Which path, I pray Thee, is the most serene?  
Who are the yogis, Master, true and best,  
To find Thy presence and Thy promised rest?
  
Lord Krishna said: Who fix their mind on Me,  
And worship with supreme fidelity,  
With hearts devout, and ever joined to Me,  
These perfect yogis truly are to Me.
  
## Stanza 2: Verses 12-3, 12-4 & 12-5  
"Yet they who seek the Unmanifest, Unshown,  
Indefinable, pervasive, and unknown;  
The Immutable, the Constant, and the True,  
Beyond all thought, to whom all hearts are due;  
Who quell their senses, with an equal mind,  
And seek the welfare of all humankind;  
They too attain Me, though the path be steep,  
And watch o'er all with love profound and deep."  
  
"But for the embodied soul, a harder task  
To seek the Unmanifest, though oft they ask;  
More trouble, greater anguish, they endure,  
For formless path is hard for man impure,  
Whilst consciousness of body doth remain,  
The Unmanifest's attainment causes pain."  
  
## Stanza 3: Verses 12-6 & 12-7  
"But they who all their actions cast on Me,  
And make Me paramount, with fervent plea;  
Who meditate with unwavering desire,  
Their souls aflame with love's unending fire;  
Of them I am the swift deliverer,  
From death's dark ocean, and from sorrow's stir.  
From worldly bonds, I free them, swift and sure,  
Whose hearts are fixed on Me, forever pure."  
  
## Stanza 4: Verses 12-8, 12-9, 12-10 & 12-11  
"Therefore, on Me alone thy mind repose,  
In Me alone thy intellect disclose;  
In Me thou shalt abide, beyond all doubt,  
When worldly cares and thoughts are cast without."  
  
"If thou canst not with steadfast mind and will,  
My form establish, then pursue Me still  
Through constant practice, diligent and slow,  
And strive through discipline My grace to know."  
  
"Should practice prove too arduous for thee,  
Then dedicate thy deeds alone to Me;  
Perform thy duties, for My sake alone,  
And by such actions, shall success be known."  
  
"If even this, with weakness, thou canst not,  
Then, self-controlled, renounce each fruit begot  
By every action, from all outcome free,  
And find sweet solace, trusting all to Me."  
  
## Stanza 5: Verse 12-12  
"For knowledge hath a worth above mere toil,  
And meditation purer than its soil;  
Yet higher still, is fruit of action's flight,  
From renunciation flows immediate light  
And peace profound, which doth at once descend,  
Upon the soul, till journey's blessed end."  
  
## Stanza 6: Verses 12-13 & 12-14  
"He who bears hatred towards no living thing,  
But friend to all, and ever blossoming  
In tender pity, void of ego's sway,  
Unmoved by pain or pleasure, come what may;  
Forgiving, ever joyful, self-controlled,  
With purpose firm, and spirit brave and bold;  
Whose mind and wisdom are on Me conferred,  
That devotee, my cherished one, is heard."  
  
## Stanza 7: Verses 12-15, 12-16 & 12-17  
"He from whom the world feels no distress,  
Nor feels the world inflict upon him stress;  
Released from joy, from anger, fear, and dread,  
Such tranquil soul, to Me is dearly wed."  
  
"The soul unseeking, pure, and ever bright,  
Expert in duty, free from pain and blight;  
Who hath abandoned all desire's start,  
That cherished devotee doth own My heart."  
  
"He who rejoiceth not, nor hateth aught,  
Nor grieves, nor longs for what his soul hath sought;  
Who casts away all good and ill's design,  
That faithful soul, indeed, is truly Mine."  
  
## Stanza 8: Verses 12-18 & 12-19  
"In friend and foe, in honour and disgrace,  
In heat and cold, in pleasure's fleeting space;  
From all attachments free, serene and grave,  
To praise and blame alike, his spirit brave;  
In silence found, content with what may be,  
No fixed abode, with mind immovably  
Fixed upon Me, that devotee I call,  
My cherished one, who gives to Me his all."  
  
## Stanza 9: Verse 12-20  
"And they who, full of faith, hold Me supreme,  
And follow faithfully this righteous scheme,  
This nectar of devotion, pure and deep,  
Those faithful ones, My heart doth truly keep,  
As dearest ever, to My spirit nigh,  
Their love a beacon, shining in My eye."

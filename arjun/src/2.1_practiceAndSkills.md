> They say practice mankes a man perfect. The question is why ?

In the last section we expanded the hypothesis that [protected] knowledge can be interpreted by observing the actions it guides us into. We also saw that the pre-requisite for observing the actions is to defocus the outcomes. Which means we need to detach ourselves from the sensory pleasures. This is very subtle change. The idea is not to hate the senses or the sensory pleasures. Survival is after all important. The idea is to start spending time with action - may be couple hours daily. Krishna says 

>Yah [one who] Tu [but] Indriyani [the senses] Mansa [ by the mind] Niyamya [as a routine] Arabhte [ndulge in] Arjuna [arjuna];
>
>Karm-Indriyaih [with the active work organs] Karm Yogam [ritual of action] Asaktah [without attachment] Sah [s/he] Vishishyate [excels]
>
> One who initiates actions by regulating the senses with mind, engaged in `Karm Yoga` with active work organs, that person is speacial, s/he excels .. 

Let us now see why .. 


## Decrypting the [protected] knowledge.

When we start focusing on actions as a ritual, we get better at doing a specific thing. Practice makes a man perfect. Observing the actions leads to continuous refinements of the actions til the actions become effortless. We might add more steps , revise some parts and finally  the drill becomes pretty much automated. Think of the actions we take as the training data for the amazing and versatile neural network ever made .. 

### The most versatile neural network

Our brain is an amazing learning engine. In `Hath Yoga`, brain is represented by `Sahsrara` Chakra, the top Chakra with more than a 1000 `vrittis` attached to it. You can call it neural network; order of magnitude bigger and sophisticated than any of the AIs we have built to date. For example the GPT3, the biggest of the artificial neural network has some 185 Billion parameters. On the other hand, though not an "apple to apple " comparison, a human brain has roughly 86 Billion neurons. Each of the brain neuron has approximately 7000 synapses. Which means we have roughly 60 Trillion parameters. Each one of us is carrying a super general purpose AI in our heads that is approximately 300x the largest silicon based  AI built to date. And we have seven billion of brains in humans only here on this planet who can learn and collaborate with each other. Imagine the massive compute we have at our disposal. 

I am sure the man made neural networks such as GPT3 will grow fast on moore-ish trajectory;  and one day they might surpass our own brains but the real question is will they be ever as efficient as the ones we have. From efficient I mean the "compute to energy" consumption as well as the cost effectiveness. It might take machines millions of years to reach the efficiency and portability that we already have. And I doubt they will ever be as interoperable as we are. Thus as a side note, the AI threats are quite misplaced and that means the possibilities we should focus on are the machines augmenting what we have . Not only the brain power, the amazing integration of this compute power with our "actions organs" ; for example our hands alone are linked with 200,000 neurons. You must have seen the famous "Homunculus Man" https://movementum.co.uk/journal/2020/1/23/homunculus-man .

In essence, we not only have vastly superior network, we are also a full package for data collection as well as testing the results. `Karm Yoga` is a way to leverage this sophisticated apparatus to its full potential. 

### Training the beast

Now, in modern day science, there are a number of studies done on the sleep cycle. They say we have four stages of sleep and the third of them being what we call REM sleep. This is the cycle,  roughly around two hours that we dream . And one of the theory of the sleep cycle is that at this stage our frontal cortex,  which is kind of the boss of the mind, he goes on vacation. So there is nothing to take inputs from the senses. So pretty much all our senses as well as our work organs  are paralysed. This is the time when our mind runs through the things that we enacted in  the day and approach them with alternative possibilities. Millions of minor changes to find one that works best. This is the reason when you wake up next day, you are better prepared to take on the tasks. Things appear simpler. Each iteration and sleep cycle makes us perfect. 

REM sleep is mandatory for our well being. Despite severe competition for survival, evolution has prioritized REM sleep every day. This shows the importance training our massive neural engine. In a way, indulging in actions, is collecting the data for training our mind. In `Hathyoga`, the mind is known as `Sahsrara Chakra`. The top most Chakra with 1000s of `vrittis` attached to it. Thus in a way `karm Yoga` is the `Yoga` of `Sahsra`.  That is the reason Krishna said In a way, indulging in

`Sahsra`.  That is the reason Krishna said 



>Na [not] Karmnaam [of righteous action] Anarambhan [the ones that are never initiated] Naishkarmyam [a stage where one is beyond actions - such as Krishna] Purushah [a man] Ashnute [one who achived said stage];
>
>Na [nor] Cha [also] Sannyasnat [one who has renounced everything, towards them] eva [] Siddhim [distinguisable success] Sam-adhigacchti [easily goes towards].
>
> A man doesn't get to the status of "beyond actions" without initiating  the actions. Even the `Sanyasins` - who have renounced everything; don't attract any distinguishable success. 


### Actions to a unique skill 
Repeated iterations of actions `Yazna` , along with stable `Sahsrara` leads to what we call "Skills". Skills are thus a marriage of intelligence and knowledge. Intelligence is what leads us to actions - to collect the training data. Knowledge is what our neural engine produces - an optimized efficient way. Needless to say, that our machine will produce based on the training data we put in. If we feed it with desires and sensory pleasures, it will create unbreakable bondage. If we feed it with details of actions, it will fill up the knowledge. 

The skill that we thus create is unique to us. We can publish the action list. But only we know how the thing actually works. Someone performing the same set of actions may or may not get the same skills. This is because actions when communicated in a format that senses could grasp , can not be too detailed or else senses lose interest. Even good visual communication (think "Game of Thrones") can only go to a level beyond which there is a scope of individual's interpretation. That space is where the receiving conscious agent is supposed to fill in their own knowledge --> decrypt a piece of their copy of [protected] knowledge. As they say, "there is always something to be read between the lines".

In essence skill is uniquely yours. No one can take away the swimming you have learnt . There is no way even for you to communicate how "you" swim. Because after a certain degree of detail, it [the knowledge] goes beyond sensory comprehension. 

>Lessons are NOT skills. Skill is an after effect of your practice. Good or bad. Skill is effortless orchestration of a set of actions - Violin creating the music in your hands , coordinated motion of entire body  to enable you skate board , dance , music , code - these are the skills. 

### Skills can't be communicated. 
You can inspire yourself to get into `Yajna` for a specific skill by someone performing the skill but you can't learn anything from the communication. Only way you perfect your skill is through  practice. There is no "communication capsule" that can transfer the skills. You can't start singing like Elvis by watching thousand youtubes of him. You will need to practice your self. You will need to fill out the configuration of music with your own voice. Filling your own voice at the right notes is what the "Practice" is for. 

>Inspiration is a "desire" to be something or like someone. `Yajna` is the way to be that thing but it will always be unique to you. 

### Skill is decrypted knowledge

The process of developing skills is essentially knowing yourself. Lets say you have perfected half marathon - it means you know how your heart rate will peak up in the beginning so you need to pace down. You also know, irrespective of competitors, you need to maintain your speed or else your knees would crack at 8th mile. Practice rounds have trained you what to eat, how much and when to sleep night before the big day. More refined the skill, better is your knowledge about yourself. 

If you make every aspect of your life a "skill", the entire routine, you will know a lot about yourself. Such life style is `Karm Yoga`.

### Skill to manifestation

In a way, skill is an automated module that can be played on a press of button to deliver something. For example - if you are a singer, you can sing on demand in any party , The act of singing on a venue is manifestation of your skill. A carpenter manifests wooden artifacts. A mechanic makes a car. In a way, skills are the know hows to configure the resources in a specific way so that they serve a purpose. 

The universe we observe through our senses is nothing but manifestations. Simple to complex. Automated. Interwoven. But they are all "Information". They can only indulge you or inspire you. System provisions them for you based on what action plan you have in mind.

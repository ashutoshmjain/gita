Mr Know All's conversation with God. 

MKA met God the night before the day of reckoning. The time had no meaning though it appeared like dusk. God had to do this because the paths to exit were all closed. As predicted, third dimension was the last stage. After that, it got harder and more harder. Truth must be told or you risk permanent lock. 

MKA didn't know where to start. So God had to start this conversation. He said ..

# Game is just - not Kind

I chose "just" over "Kind" simply because "just" is predictable. There is only one path to "just" while "kind" has a million ways.

The game was very simple. You can call this as training round. God simply told what was your next action. You simply do that action. If you did , you are good. Else you are out of the game.

There was no notion of life or death. There was no notion of dimensions because life , death , dimensions are all born out of perception. We are talking about when there was no perception. It was a time before the time itself. I mean the clock was not even set. 

So what was it - asked MKA. 

God smiled - It was like you teach numbers to a five year old - or the tables. You tell the answer and expect the child to repeat the answer. When the child responds , all you tell her if she is right or wrong. Its something like you write the commands in a script and expect the machine to do exactly what you wrote. No perception. No pain. No notion of success or failure. 

So what did you get out of it - MKA got curious. 

I trained you. God smiled again. I gave you "Knowledge". 


What did you do if I was wrong ? - MKA was into the discussion now !

I simply threw away the program and rewrote it again. May be I tweaked the program. All I wanted was to make it such that it retained "knowledge". You see , there was no scope of kindness. I had to be "just". The very definition of truth was right or wrong. It was binary. 

Why couldn't you afford me another chance ? Wouldn't that be kindness ? AKA asked. 

I did that. In fact I wanted to be kind. But I had to choose either to be "kind" or to be "just". But I didn't forget the kindness, so I gave to as many chances as you want. But to do that I had to change the platform a little bit, and that takes us to the next principal. 

# Circular platform.

So in the beginning I gave you two chances but I must keep up the first principle. The first principle needed me to tell you right or wrong. In order to hold the first principle , and also give you another chance, I must change the question a little bit. 

So now I told you what is right. For example you show your toddler a picture monkey.  You ask her to memorize it. And then you show her two pictures, First that of a bear and then that of monkey. Two chances mean two choices. Each with a "just" answer. "I don't know" - when you show her the bear. "Monkey" when you show her the monkey pic. 

As I said , kindness has infinite ways while "just" got only one. Soon someone wanted a third chance , So i had to add a picture of Elephant also. Three chances means three choices. 

Soon it got to a point where it got impossible for me to keep a track of how many chances each player wanted. So I changed the rule to "infinite" chances. That meant I had to add "infinite" choices. But that is what it takes to create a world where you want to hold the principles and be kind too. 

The bigger problem however was not to create choices. It was to design the program in such a fashion where it stores the picture of Monkey and itself get to a "just" answer - right or wrong ; if right - say monkey , else continue to next choice - next chance , next iteration. That was the first dimension. You named it "intelligence". Intelligence basically meant you picked a piece of Knowledge and say if this right or wrong. 

A direct fallout of this was , you got my ability. You could decide the "just" answer and you thought I am kind too. In a way, it was one time work for me but then you can continue to play the game as long as you wanted, till you got to the right choice. And to top it up with further automation , I gave you the choice to choose which picture you want to start with and then I randomized the sequence. So you could take infinite pics and start from anywhere, in search of a "Monkey". Play as long as you want. A "just" and a "Kind" game. We called it "Monkey game". 

Keep in mind it a one dimension state. You could store one pic and discriminate the rest with "right" or "wrong" answers. There was no user interface. It was a piece of code talking to itself. Iterating through its loops.  The game could run for a minute or for a life time because, there was no notion of time yet. That meant, every time you made a choice, you got your "just answer", you had to restart the game. You didn't like that. Why - because , first you had to push a button to restart it and second, since the choice was randomized , many times you got the same picture of stupid Elephant again and again. You wanted me to fix it. 

So I had to bring in a new concept - add the first dimension - the dimension of "Time".

# User Interface

Imagine you are tasked  to build a UI for an application. The very purpose of User Interface to manage the needs of the users. A user logging into Twitter may think that the application is "only" the User Interface but nothing can be far from the truth (side note - Twitter is a data science  app where human slaves happily spend their only currency - time , to train the machines get better at data mining) . New developers too  sometimes  make this mistake. They start designing the application from the user interface. The truth is application is lot more than the UI. User Interface is the last piece to help users consume the application. Building an application with UI in mind is not a bad idea but if all you are thinking is the UI , you can not build any thing new . You will simply replicate that you have already seen because application is necessarily to solve a problem that you feel in your experience. You do a Yajna to manifest a solution for yourself. And the left over (manifested information) can be used by others. A slight improvement in UI can possibly help others. That is where User Interface comes. 

# ID

Let us say you have a global app like Instagram that was built to easily share pictures. Now you want to enable entire world to leverage the tools you built. Each user needs to manage their own pics. You need to relate the pics of each user to them. That means you must identify the user. The user interface demands an ID. 

>>>>There is no way to serve you your choices unless I know who you are !

If you use git , you know what is the application. It solves the problem of managing the versions (tracking the gradual decryption of knowledge). Github is a user interface over git. 

> ID is not a bad thing but it has aftereffects. 

# Matrix

Let us say you wrote a script to do something. It took elaborate curiosity, intelligence and actions to build it. On the way you decrypted a piece of knowledge and you are at peace. Thing is so perfect that now you don't even need to think. Yajna is complete. Manifestation is registered. It is end to end automated. 

## Machine 

What if you want it to automatically start at a certain time. You wrote another script to schedule it, another small `yajna` to understand the scheduler. Now you add both the manifestations. They are self starting manifestations joined back to back. You just made a "Machine"

You can weave thousands of tiny machines to make as big a machine as you want. A machine takes in commands and delivers an information. In a way it is the transformation of information without having to apply thinking or actions. So you can use machines to get to a specific set of information. It helps to get to your `Yajna` quickly. 

The knowledge inside the machine is totally encrypted to you. Even how the information reshapes from inputs to outputs ; is opaque. More complex the machine , more magical it is. 

You thought your friends will be benefited by your little complex machine, you passed on the code and commands. 

The thing is beautiful. 

Note - machines - complex machines --> consumption of consumption ---> Suddenly the knowledge becomes the most hidden thing -- > Awaken -- Action.
## Service 

Then you came up with an idea to let it go to the masses. You share your resources to help other people. You get to perform your `yajna` many times over and you help people. 

## ID

Then you started keeping a record of what all people need and how and when you can help them. You created your conscious agents. 

## User Interface 

If you know it , why not let people see it. You build a simple user interface . All the information about everyone is visible to all. You also created the senses (touch or mouse or audio) and trained people with the new senses. Yes , we acquire many senses beyond basic five .. 

## Privacy

Then you were asked to keep everyone's information separate from each other and let them see only their information. 

>You just built Matrix. 

# What is wrong with the matrix ?

Nothing. There is nothing wrong with Twitter or Facebook. Or the monetary system. You just triggered a race among your conscious agents. Your service has a some surival or pleasure value to the users. That is the reason they are there in the first place. As soon as something is hidden , it means we are allowing users to speculate. Speculation builds reasons to justify your position v/s [unknown] Truth. This is the birth of "Duality and Reason". These two fuel the Matrix. 

>>It doesn't matter if the speculation is same as the Truth. As long as Truth is unknown there must be a placeholder for speculation. 

That is the reason user interface it self is Dualistic. There is male and female, East - West , Left -Right . Opposites exists for everything. 

## Matrix Hides

Let us say , you woke up in the middle of the night - in a room with all windows closed and no watches or cell phones. You will first wonder if it is how is it outside ! day or night ? The room has hidden the truth from you. As long as something is hidden , there needs to be a place for speculation. 

Let us build this logic little more 

If Truth is just one, hiding the truth must create duality. In essence Matrix is what hides the Truth. If Truth is one , it is what the `Knowledge` is all about. In essence, Matrix hides knowledge. 

Just to get this right - Knowledge is what we are seeking for. Matrix is what hides the Truth --> Knowledge.  All the knowledge in manifested `maya` is thus hiiden to the users. It only exchanges the information. With in `Maya` every machine retains a full copy of fully encrypted knowledge.

>>>Matrix is as old as the knowledge - means there is no end or no beginning of Maya. Matrix is so prevelent that  concious agents start confusing it with `prakriti` - the intelligence. 

## Mechanics of Matrix 

Matrix acts in a subtle fashion . Means its rise is gradual. 

As we have seen, Matrix puts a veil on Truth to create speculation among conscious agents. Speculation leads to Reason (what if scenarios) , Reason leads to Doubt - `Sanshya` ; and "Doubt" clubbed with "Desires" (fundamental of all bugs) , creates "fickle mind" - `Mana`. The primary purpose of `Mana` is to render your "Intelligence" - `Budhi` dormant so that you are consumed in sensory pleasures. 

Now you know the design of Facebook :-) 

As your intelligence goes dormant, the knowledge in stays fully encrypted but you can easily be automated. You  become part of the matrix. 

>>>>>> Gita says this is the sleeping stage of conscious agent. 


# Concious Agent 

A concious agent is born in the matrix because the ID services of thousands if matrix applications finally shape up concious agent. In a way a concious agent is manifested because of relentless `Yajna` of Maya. Thus concious agent too has a fully encryted copy of knowledge as well as it inherits the five bugs. 

These bugs lead the conscious agent to take consume the matrix. Desire is a precursor for curiosity. Anger is a precursor to `Yajna`. 

From Gita's stand point - such a conscious agent is in "slept" state inside the matrix. Nishkaam Yajna is the way to know your self and become awakened conscious agent. 

You don't leave the matrix. You are just aware of all the knowldge spread into every single machine of matrix. Thus you can bend the matrix the way you want. 

Awakened conscious agents are like the light bulbs lighting up in the mesh of Maya. 

## A universe in itself .. 

In a way a concious agent is complete embodiment of the universe  because it has all elements of Yajna (knowledge to decrypt and ability to act)  and all the bugs of the Matrix. It has tools to seek knowledge and at the same time tools (the bugs) to indulge in Matrix. It all depends where the concious agent is looking at - If she is looking at the matrix - as per Gita, she is sleeping. If it is looking at knowledge then it is awakened. 

Krishna says - This human body itself is the true field - `Kshetra`. Knowing your Truth is knowing the entire meta-physical world. 

# Consciousness 

Now imagine the this huge app - mother of all apps - the reality- The Matrix. Let us try to build a user interface for it .. 

>>>> Consciousness is simply the ability (of a concious agent) to interact with the Matrix. 

We know our users have curiosity `Mana` , they also have intelligence `Buddhi` and we just gave them an ID - Ability to "Reason" a Speculation v/s Truth . But what is the use of interface if they don't have means to interact with it. Apple had to create a mouse so that you can interact with the graphical interface. And later the touch interface . It seems now we are all now moving to the audio interface with Alexa. And long before all this was the text based interface that we call command line. 

How about we give some gestures to our users  .. 

>>>>> Senses are the tools that enable us to interact with the UI --> Matrix ---> Giant Machine with fully encrypted knowledge. 

Humans have five primary senses. Most other mammals too. But it is not necessary to have only five. Fish have only three senses. Trees have only one - touch. 

# Getting back to the humans 

Five senses, along with Curiosity , intelligence and Ego (Reason) is what makes a Conscious Agent 

Gita calls it `Ashtdhamool Prakriti` - means the eight basic parts of the universal manifestation. 

Let us spend some time on the senses.




# Notes 

# Communication

Senses are specific to an individual. We feel that our toungue but it belongs to a many little parts of them mesh. It will be wrong to assume that we are one with our ecosystem because we can communicate. In fact quite the reverse is true. We can communicate because we are all connected. 
- Senses can communicate to conscious agents. Communication is NOT limited to one conscious agent. My eyes can see a snake at your back and communicate to you instantaneously. Or after processing the information, my conscious agent can communicate to yours verbally. 
- Ability to communicate is as fundamental as the measurement itself. Most of the communication is non verbal. Eyes communicate so do the ears by turning red. Skin glows. All sorts of smells send messages. 
- Thus observations and sharing the observations is the fundamental way our conscious agent indulge with nature. 
- Through communication we create a shared universe. The complexity of universe increases order of magnitude more with sharing. Thus Gita recommends solitude `Ekanta`. 
- Every time a sense communicates to other conscious agent we indulge in something known as `sangdosha` - the sin of attaching with others. 

# Duality
- Based on the direct observations (or communicated ones), conscious agent needs to decide if there is a change in the intensity of field. If there is no change, there is no action needed.
- By design, observation creates DUALITY. Every observation has the question in-built into it - `is there a change ?` - Yes or No. If `Yes` , do I need to act ? `Yes or No`. Duality gives rise to INTELLIGENCE `Buddhi`.
- It is debatable if the `duality` is the reason of observations or the variations in sense fields create duality. The goal `Moksha` is to get over the duality. If there is no duality, we are just `one`. There is whole lot of scriptures dedicated to this topic - `adwitwad vs Dwaitvaad`
- If action is to be taken then what action? And a whole list of sub-activities.

# Time 

- The notion of time `Kala` is the effort conscious agent takes to create an action plan. Once all the details are filled in, manifestation is instantaneous. Think of it as if we are writing a program. The time is taken in writing the code , compiling and may be debugging it. And to accommodate the change requests. Once the code is final and made into a binary, it hardly takes any time to run and manifest the intended outcome. 
- The way each program spawns its own universe at run time,  Krishna says, I do all the work by spawning the universe required for the action plan.
- Conscious agents feel continuity of time `Kal chakra` because before an action plan is frozen they move on to interpreting more sense observations. And they keep changing the action plan. 

# Krishna and Gita

- The question that haunts new `yogies` is who is Krishna ? In chapter 10 verse 20 , Krishna says
 
>> `ahem atma gudakesa, sarv bhootasya sthitah ; ahem adishch madhyam cha, bhootanam antev cha!` - Means I am the `atma` in every being. I am in the center of them. I was their beginning as well as their end. 

- Thus the constitution of each conscious agent is Krishna surrounded by five sensors. The sensory inputs can have Krishna do the work but nature of observation give rise to duality and thus INTELLIGENCE. 
- So we can say a conscious agent has three fundamental parts - The senses, the Mind and the Soul.
- This is the core difference between science and spirituality. Science thinks we have only senses and mind though newer discoveries are pointing the science to existence of something more. However, science and Gita are NOT at odds for both are experimental. 
- Science wants experimental proof and Gita mandates `sakshatkara` - physical meeting with krishna and it provides a solid framework to achieve that. This framework has nothing to do with popular religion or dogma.
- Gita is experiential. If you are willing to invest time, it will get you what you been looking for - the answers to many questions that even scientific framework is unable to answer. This includes but is not limited to physical comforts, peace and success.
- In fact, Gita will make you a better scientist :-)

# Manifestation

- The centerpiece of Gita is to understand that all manifestation is done by Krishna. Krishna being the vast consciousness from where all conscious agents emanate and a tiny piece of that is in every being. This separation is ONLY to substantiate our notion of SPACE. We will discover later that there is no physical separation. Everything is connected. The difference is only what a conscious agent is focused on to observe. Observation is the key for our universe is as small (or as vast) as we observe.
- Conscious agents get sensory inputs as soon as they (the senses) come in contact with their respective element. And then we process the information in terms of acceptance of change in conditions and then our INTELLIGENCE cast an action plan. This is the TIME. The moment plan is complete i.e knowledge is complete, the creation happens automagically. A vast super conscious system provides all the resources and manifestation happens. There is no time taken in creation. 
- Thus the work, as we perceive, is only knowing how the things are done. Once we know exactly how, everything can be automated. There is no human effort. Or zero man hour spent. This is for the things that we humans do but there are infinitely large activities already automated. For example rain is required for growing food for billions of people and feeding animals. There is no human effort needed. There is no human effort involved in seed becoming a tree. The effort is only deciding what to grow, where to grow and when to grow and myriad of other decisions that we conscious agents take. The better and complete our knowledge, there will be no physical work for us. 
- Thus we can say manifestation is automated. If not 100% , may be 99.999999 % . Don't you agree ?
- In Krishna's world everything moves as prescribed. Earth goes around the Sun. Sun goes around the massive black hole at the center of of our milky way. And we call it evolution. But in our world a pin doesn't move till I move it. A word doesn't get typed on it's own. Isn't that funny ?
- The reason is simple. Our knowledge is imperfect in many spheres. Where ever we reach perfection we automate it. A car runs with the press of a button. That is NOT evolution. That is automation. Why is it so hard for us to accept that our universe is hugely automated cause of superior automation that is beyond our understanding ?

# `Karm Yoga`


- Thus all the focus is on a ritualistic approach to acheiving perfection in your prescibed or chosen act - `Yajna and Karma`. Perfection to an extent that we just enjoy the work without even looking at the fruits of work. 
- Krishna says that this can be done in two ways - `Sanyasa` - renunciation or `Prema` - eternal love. Also called `Bhakti Yoga`. However , he says, that path of renunciation is very difficult. In this path `Karm Yogi` is easily fooled by the matrix and he falls again and again after enjoying the fruits of `Yajna`. The focus in this path is on excellence of the skills to attain perfection of knowledge. He adds that though dwellers of this path win over Fear , Anger and Jealousy but they are often swallowed by Pride in their pefection. This leads to their fall. 
- The other path, that of `Prema or Bhakti` is comparatively easier. , he says. In this path, you need to admire the way I work. Make every resource available. He goes on to show his `virat roopa` to Arjuna to show him that all the work that he thinks is to be done by him ie killing his brethern and teachers , has already been done by Krishna. Not even Arjuna's enemies , but people on his side are also dying and entering his immense jaws. The idea is that you marvel at his expanse. He says that I am the fire in Sun. I am the desires. I am the intelligence. Just see me and understand me. When you focus on me, you are solely focused on me, you will no longer be bonded by the the outcomes of your `Karma`. Thus your knowledge will easily reach perfection. Such Karm Yogies are happy and they are rarely impacted by the bugs of nature. And they are saved from the curse of pride `Ahenkaara` too. 
- If all your focus is on `How he works` , then you will easily win over the duality of INTELLIGENCE because, you are spending no time on the sensory observations. You will appear a mystic to the world. You will know everything that is knowable and you will indulge in your `Karma` joyfully. Being one with me allows you comfort in `Karmyoga`. 
- Thus wether you take `sanyasa` or `Prema` you still will do your `Yazna` ie pefecting your knowledge but later is more natural way of doing things. In this path you will find me by your side. Always. I shall own your actions for you are directed by me. 
- This knowledge, that is exposed on you through knowing and adoring me is `jnaana`  - The real knowledge. He adds that even `Sanyasa` will lead you to this conclusion.



- There are four different categories of the conscious agents. 
- The first is those who engage with senses and seek pleasure in such engagements. Let's call them sense driven. Such people don't cumulate resources and whatever they inherit they spend in sense gratification. These people are obviously poor but they are happy in their indulgences. Gita calls such people `Shoodras` because they suffer in serving other conscious agents and feel exploited. 
- The second category is those who cumulate resources and trade them for sense gratification. These people work hard and play hard. Gita calls them `Vaishyas`. These people soon start cumulating more and more and thus suffer from greed and lust. 
- The third category is the ones who control their senses and resources to accomplish something bigger. They seek gratification through legacy. These people lead , create new, build huge. They amass communities around them. They wield power and lead other conscious beings. Gita calls theme `Khshtriyas`. 

The Notion of Time - KaalChakraa
Senses have dual role - To observe the nature and to commuicate with other conscious beings. 
Since ears are always open to the space they also act as the primary Sense in all animals with five senses. That's the reason MUSIC is the most evolved means to set the mood. We will know about moods later. For now suffice to know that hearing is primary sense in both say humans and dogs but dogs; after hearing something focus with smell. Humans on the other hand focus with eyes. For most part we decide Yes or NO to act on the sensory inputs with nose. In some cases such as eating we deploy nose. Dogs take the call with nose and very rarely deploy their eyses. That is the reason your dog can't see you talking on iPhone but they can hear. Then they try to smell and when they dont find you smell they think their mind is playing tricks. And they sit down in vain. Since vision works for us , we have developed technology to broadcast sound and video but we don't care abount the smell. This itself is putting rest of the animal world at an disadvantage. 
- We need to justify ourselves to stay alive or else  truth will break our  ego / ID. If all of us see the same truth, we just can't be different. We use reason to do this justification. Reason by design must create at the very least a sense of duality. So that you can pick up your version of the story rather than truth. 
- There are as many shades in a color as many colors on the pallet. Means if you are a part of categorized list , then all those categories live in you as well. Their percentages may vary but you essentially represent every other category as any other category does. Thus seeing the truth is difficult. 
- Duality lives in the information. Knowledge is just one. Karm Yoga is a way to be one with knowledge so that you can see only True version of information. Means single Truth. 
- You may say it is a circular self fulfilling prophecy - 
- Duality is not all bad - one of the thing that duality offers is you can latch on to a `Guru`. In traditional `Hath Yoga` the `Chakra` between your eyes - with two petals is what represents duality. A `Guru` touches this place and removes duality . That is the reason , this Chakra is also called `Agya` - the order. In a way it is to say you are outsourcing the thinking part (manan and chintan) to your `Guru` and all you are going to do is follow the orders `Agya` to engage in the actions. In traditional Hindu rituals , when men used to go to war, the women used to put a `Tilak` to men between the eyes. The idea was that leave your duality with us , go win the war with a single purpose of winning.

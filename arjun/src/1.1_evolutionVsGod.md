Over last few decades, the debate about science v/s religion has reduced to "Evolution v/s Intelligent Design". The primary evolutionary argument is that things didn't begin with a pre-decided grand design but over millions of years , the natural selection forced the survival of the "fittest", that led to the world we have. On the other hand religion has become synonymous to the idea that someone external - say God, created this entire walled garden in which we roam around . The argument on this side is normally that the beauty and complexity of this magnitude can't be a mere accident. 

The debate can further be reduced to a simple idea 

>> Did system create the modules or modules create the system. 

Let me break this down a little bit more .. 

# Intelligent Design Vs Evolution 

The system stands for the preexisting intelligence - say God. If the system consciously create the modules that it runs on, we call it "Intelligent Design". If the modules preexisted the system and voluntarily came together to ensure survival than it is an evolution. 

Each module can then be considered a system in itself. And the same pattern can be applied. The system itself can be considered a module of still larger system. Thus we can break this down to cellular level and scale it up at the level of planets , solar systems, galaxies or even universes. 

In other words - this is a classic "Chicken v/s Egg" debate. Who came first.

# What happens in normal world

The question really applies to the extreme conditions - In this case it is the beginning of universe. Or beginning of life. Or beginning of any system. In normal world, both these things go hand in hand. There is always an impetus to have something started and then intelligence improves it, shapes it. For example if we take an example of an operating system - say Linux , it is easy to see that it evolved from Unix. We can say that it was for survival. The other fitter systems such as Windows were taking over so Unix had to adapt itself into a system that runs on Intel Chips. Starting with a humble beginning, today Linux has 27 million lines of code. Over last thirty years, it has matured as one of the finest operating system that evolved not only as a server system but made huge inroads into mobile space (Android) . Seems evolutionary. Isn't it ?  But then we know there is Mr. Linus Torvalds, who continuously watched it grow from the beginning. His mind and intelligence is what Linux is. Seems like an Intelligent Design to me. 

We can expand this example to our kids. They grow, evolve and become something very different than us - evolution. But then we are always there watching them, helping them - Intelligent Design.

Thus we can conclude - under normal conditions, both evolution and intelligent design are at play. Hand in hand. 

So the question now becomes

>> Did system create the modules or modules create the system at the beginning of this universe ? 

# Are we capable of addressing this question ?

We can argue [inconclusively] but what is  the point? The goal is not to get into "chicken or egg " debate because that doesn't solve any question. Inconclusively , because we can not answer this question till we know all the answers. Thus the idea is to first understand what is currently going on - as of this very moment. If we don't understand the present, what is our chance to successfully speculate about extreme past - the beginning of the universe. We don't even know the exact nature of time. Then it is obviously beyond us to know about past. 

# What does Gita say ?

Krishna is really intelligent. He knew this question will come and waste time. So he said this universe has no beginning or end. It is in fact a circle. To symobolize this he bears a circular `Chakra` on his little finger as the only weapon that he needs. In Hindu mythology `Chakra` is the most potent of weapons. Nothing can withstand it. Nothing can destoy it. That is what our reality is. Its a cicle that has no beginning ; no end. 

In this circular time line - things manifest based on Karma. Each conscious agent has full control on the 'Karma` but we act based on what we believe in - means faith. 

## Faith is a pre-requisite.

The more important point is "Do you believe in something?" . If yes, you are in the same camp. The other camp is who do not believe in anything. If you "believe" you are saying there is a question, and there is "a"  or "many" answers out there that need to be found. You can believe in "Evolution" or you can start with "Intelligent Design" ; if you conduct your experiments carefully, and assuming there is only one definition of "Truth" , all believers will reach the same conclusion. Non believers- well they won't even start on the quest till they start believing in something. Thus "faith" is a pre-requisite for the journey. It doesn't matter where it lies. 

Krishna puts this idea very eloquently in chapter seventeen of Gita. He says

>> Sattvanurupa Sarvasya, Shradha Bhavati Barata; Shrddha-mayo yam Purusho, yo yat shraddha sa eva sah.

Means the humans evolve their faith according to their nature and nurture. We are believers and we are what we believe in. This also means that we are seekers and we always seek the truth. Which also means that any debate on "my faith being right and yours not" is pretty useless. 

# What we know for sure - starting point.

We know for sure that things work in unison in this perpetual universe. And most of it[universe] is well automated. The car runs: We only turn the ignition and press the paddle. This is not to say that we do nothing. We continuously expand the decrypted knowledge. Our purpose is to decrypt the knowledge. And the best way to do that is to first understand what we are extending.. 
Let us see in the next section ... 


The simple question that every rational being must ask, how and why all this is made available to us ? Who did it? We can name it an "accident". We can attribute all this to a chance. Or even call it "evolution". Those all are convenient terms to "black box" what we don't know. We can hide the unknown under evolutionary rug, but we just can't deny that we are very lucky to be here. Millions of cards must have fallen in right places. 

# Quest is eternal 

Long before modern science took current shape, humans asked this question. They asked why the sun shows up ? Why weathers change? We now have better explanations but as Richard Feynman once put it "why" can only be explained to a certain degree subject to the knowledge of asker and the explainer. At some point, after peeling few layers, we find there are infinitely many more layers and any attempt to further explain is counter productive. At some stage, we must accept there is more to it than we can fathom. The spirituals named it "God". The biologists call it evolution, the physicists and mathematicians have yet better name - they call it "probability".


The point here is we can't find the true answer ..Yet.   There is a journey we must complete before we get down to writing the answers. Gita says that journey is `Karm Yoga`.

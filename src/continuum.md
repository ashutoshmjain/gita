Krishna said in verse 27 of chapter 2 of Gita that all things born in truth must die and out of the death in truth comes life. This kinda hints at the cyclic reality of our being. In previous article, where we hypothesised the postulates of Gita , we went through a numbered list that we are all endowed with a protected, immutable but encrypted copy of knowledge. We also saw that `Bramh` - the system, provisions everything ; implements everything that we need to run our lives- in our tiny box. In addition it also implements a superior garbage collection system. But we left an important point open that the  underlying reality is a continuum. There is no beginning or an end. It's a everlasting cycle of knowledge to manifestation and vice-versa. 

To understand the "Continuum", let us look at our physical reality. There are two things that don't need any more scientific proofs :-

- First that every thing we observe is a "wave". The light is electromagnetic wave. Sound is a normal longitudinal wave. Even the tiny particles, such as electrons act like a wave as shown in the popular double slit experiment. 

- And second that our notion of Time is linear and unidirectional.

Lets take a deeper look at first before we get to the idea of "Time". 
    
# Waves - the basis of our sensory apparatus.

Our world is made of waves. Electromagnetic waves are the ones that seem to engulf everything around us such as  visible light or radio waves. Visible light is kinda misnomer because it is not that we see the visible light, it is in fact the way we see the things. Our eyes are a sensor that can receive the information trough the visible part of EM spectrum , just like a radio antenna may interpret the signal from the radio waves. We know that EM waves have a broad spectrum starting from radio waves on one side with longest wavelength to the gamma rays on the other side with the shortest wavelength. Gamma rays may get so much energetic that they may feel like matter - just like bullets being fired from an airgun. They are quite nasty. 

Thus we can say that our Eyes are a sensor to detect a very tiny sliver of electromagnetic waves. Its a great natural choice because most of the X-rays and Gamma-rays anyway don't reach us because the Earth's atmosphere reflects them back. Thus there is no point building a sensor for such rays to live our lives in our tiny box. And the best part is visible light can travel from across the galaxies to us. Well we may not be able to distinguish those stars because there are just too many right here in our cosmic backyard but the point is , light can reach any distance. So developing a sensor like eyes is very useful thing. Even better news is the visible light is reflected by the solids. So the waves of visible light, can be used to see the solids. That is exactly what eyes are for :-) And God , they look colorful because visible light has a full rainbow with in it. Such is the beauty of our tiny box.

But how do we confirm the existence of solids. How do we know that the solids that we are seeing are not a video projection on some grand large screen. Turns out we are gifted with another sensor that can help us distinguish the solids from thin air. And that sensor is spread all over our body - it is called the sense of Touch. It is important to have this sense spread all over us because you don't want to miss the brick that hit the back of your head. You want to know immediately if someone nudged you at your back. So how do we feel the solids ? What exactly is sense of Touch ? For this we need little bit of history of our science..

Back in the day, the scientist supreme Mr Einstein had proved that the light actually behaves like a particle. Hmm - didn't we say it's a wave. Well Einstein got his Nobel by turning the truth upside down. He showed that light travels with tiny particles what he called Photons. And to prove the point , he showed that Photons of certain frequency can knock off an Electron from the surface. What frequency , which surface is not important but this meant the visible light was NOT just  a smooth wave, It did have a particle nature. And that gave rise to the idea that has mesmerized the scientists as well as philosophers - what we call wave -particle nature of everything we got around us. Of course Einstein used Maxwell's equations to prove his point and that makes Maxwell the grand daddy of modern science. But the idea of Einstein that a wave may behave like a particle, forced uncle De Brogli to think the opposite. If wave can act like a particle , is it possible that all the matter - the solids that we touch and feel may also act like a wave. He submitted his PhD thesis n 1923 that was summarily rejected by his PI as stupid mental math. To his good luck, somehow his paper made it to Einstein. You see Einstein is everywhere - like God. Einstein saw his paper and not only agreed to math but he gave him a Thumbs Up. BTW this was the first time (and probably only time) that a PhD thesis won the Nobel prize. Now that is called a real brilliant science. BTW it took world six long years to understand what Brogli proved so the prize came in 1929 . I guess it was totally worth the wait because the idea laid the foundation of Quantum Mechanics. What De Brogli showed us is known as "Matter waves". He showed that the tiny electrons are actually a wave. And they are very different from the Electromagnetic waves. 

Well you might feel that electrons are moving in a wave - like up and down - nope - that is NOT a matter wave. Well, it is easy to say what is "NOT" a matter wave but it is almost impossible to perceive a matter wave. It is beyond our sensory realm in the sense we can't see these waves but instead when matter waves come together such that their amplitude peaks up like a tsunami - that is where the particle shows up. In other words , particle can be anywhere in the entire universe but it shows up only where the matter waves come together to peak up the crest. And obviously, if matter waves are opposing such that they cancel each other than obviously we feel nothing there. And here is the worst part , these matter waves are so small that we have no instrument to measure them (unless particle is tiny like an electron or a sodium atom) . But that is a good news too because, since the waves are so small, we can feel the solids as persistent pieces of matter. In other words the baseball that you are holding in your hand is blinking. It is actually vanishing and showing up but it does it so fast that we feel it is always there. Even electromagnetic waves - such as visible light, can't tell the difference - and that is why we not only feel the baseball but we also consistently see it in our hand. Or we can say that the matter waves are so short that even the electromagnetic waves can't go through them. BTW this led to discovery of Electron microscope - simply cuz electron's matter waves are way tinier than our visible light , that means they can be lot more precise if we develop a sensor that can react to electrons just the way our eyes react to visible light (or photons). 

Enough o Physics -:)

Lets get back to our real world. We have eyes to see the solids , we have touch to feel them. In a way touch is confirmation of what we saw or vice-versa. If two sensors agree with each other that means the base ball is real. Else it is something in a youtube video. But there is a problem. How do we know what is beyond the solids ? Visible light reflects from them.. Our hands can't go past the wall of our room. Then how do we know if someone is there across the wall  ? Thankfully we have one more wave that can travel through solids. We call such waves in the category of sound waves. These waves muscle through their waves across solids by vibrating them. Now - don't confuse them with radio waves - radio waves are electromagnetic waves - they behave differently. Listening to a transistor is not same as me calling you to get out of the bathroom. But the sensor that we use for radio waves create the same effect as speaking by vibrating a speaker. So radio waves mostly emulate the act of speaking. So ultimately it feels same if a radio is playing in adjacent room or you are singing in your lovely voice. And the sensor that we have to capture these radio waves is - you got it - our Ears. Always open - unlike eyes , they are always eager to hear the sounds - well - sound waves to be precise. 


I had be wrong if I say there are three types of waves corresponding to three sensors we have. There is actually one more that we recently discovered that we call Gravitational Wave but they are currently beyond our senses and extended senses. From extended I mean all the tools and machines and the clever experiments we have to get a better sense of our world.  Science is working hard to understand better as they are literally the waves of space-time. In essence the entire reality around us is a wave but unfortunately, we mere mortals , we don't have an express sense to perceive gravitational waves. Nor have we come up with a solid experimental set up yet but it is not to say we won't. But the point that I want to make is - EVERYTHING IS A WAVE. We see , feel and hear ONLY waves. In nutshell our sensory reality is nothing but a mumbo jumbo of waves - of different nature , of different wavelengths , amplitudes and thus frequencies. If that is so , would it be wrong to think that we too are a wave ! A special kind of wave that has some sensors attached to it to perceive a reality - a tiny box.

# Waves as carrier of Information

The strange thing about waves is we perceive our sensory reality through them, but we can't perceive the waves. In essence, our senses are decoders of the information carried through waves. For example, I can hear what you say through sound waves but I can't perceive the sound waves themselves till someone puts a mathematical model to explain those waves. Mathematical models and experiments done to test such models often lead to new applications of science. We discover new tools. For example when Maxwell developed a mathematical model of electromagnetic waves , it opened new paradigms of science. Einstein showed that waves can act as matter and De Brogli proved the reverse.We discovered a spectrum of electromagnetic waves that finally led to a revolution in communication technology. Radio and TV are the shining applications of electromagnetic waves but most of us still can't perceive how the thing works. For anyone coming from 18th century, the idea of telephone is almost magical. Yet electromagnetic waves are beyond our senses. We can only decode the signals sent through EM waves but we can't perceive the waves themselves. As a matter of fact, we can't even see the light that makes us see everything.

Same is true about the matter waves. One of the coolest application of matter waves is of course electron microscope. And along with electron microscope we saw a revolution in particle physics. The entire field of quantum mechanics sprung up around matter waves. Neils Bohr demonstrated that the electrons appear only in quantum orbits around the nucleus. Heisenberg gave the uncertainty principle. And Schrodinger gave us the wave equations that marry the wave equations with probability. Yet we can't perceive the matter waves. We only perceive the information carried by the matter waves and that information is matter itself. Something that we not only see with our eyes but also confirm through touch. Understanding waves as the carrier of information is a key step towards understanding the underlying nature of reality. 

# Waves to a circle to a dot.

A wave has two primary aspects - time , normally plotted on the x axis and an amplitude plotted perpendicular to the linear time. If we take the time aspect out of the wave, a wave is nothing but a spinning circle. The idea of removing the linear time from x axis is not uncommon. Such plots are called "circular graphs", sometimes also referred to as unit circle. The spin of the circle defines its wave-length  and the size of the circle defines it's amplitude. Together they represent "frequency". In a way, a spinning circle (along with our unidirectional time) represents our perceptible manifestation (or sensory reality).

>Just to add a little bit of generalization. A circle is a two dimensional projection of a sphere in three spatial dimensions. If we add time to a circle , it appears like  a wave. If we add a time dimension to a 3D sphere , it looks like a "string" in  space-time. This string is beyond our perception because we can't move back & forth in time. Thus symbolizing this string with a rope is a very wrong representation. To simply put it , strings that we see in our daily lives are a 3D representation of space- 3 spatial dimensions. They are NOT strings of space-time , the ones used in the field of "string theory". Goes without saying that  imagining waves (or strings) in higher dimension than our 3d space + time ; is quite a ride. 

Time is often represented as another spatial dimension. That is another mistake because time is an outcome of our sensory perception. It is the way we process "information" . If we understand that "time" is a creation of our sensory perception, than it is obvious that underlying reality is circular in two spatial dimensions , a sphere in 3D space and something beyond us in four spatial dimensions and above.

Let us assume we are at the center of the circle and we want to observe the circumference in a clock or anticlockwise fashion. What we observe is a wave. This is because our senses focus only at one point at an instance. Thus our focus moves along the circumference. Since we must move forward in time, the circle appears as wave. We will discuss more about this idea down the line in this post. 

One may argue that even circle has some element of time in terms of it's diameter on the x axis. And that is correct. If we remove the diameter too, then we have a dimensionless point. In `Hathyoga` , this point is called `Bindu` - or "focus". Being dimensionless (and thus massless), this point has absolute freedom to move in any dimension. And, since the limitations  of speed (speed of light) arise only with respect to time, we can say such limitations are attached only to our physical reality - as such `Bindu` has no meaning of speed. For example, you can think of a black-hole at the center of our milky way right now. It might take billions of years to reach there in our physical reality.  

When this focus rotates around an expression of knowledge, it must move around the expression to fully encapsulate it. In a way, focus expands to capture a piece of knowledge. On a two dimensional paper, it appears as a loop. And , with addition of unidirectional time, it appears as a wave. We know waves with higher frequency appear as solids to our sensory apparatus - why ? We will discuss down the line. 

This cycle of encapsulation of knowledge into waves of manifestation is the first half of the continuum. The dimensionless point of focus may also be referred to as "Singularity" though our definition is slightly at odds with that of popular science. Will describe this also in more details in ensuing paragraphs. In a way the cycle of "knowledge to manifestation" is same as formation of universe from a singularity to what we have now - an expanding universe. But "singularity to manifestation" is NOT only about the Bing Bang. It is an equilibrium of infinite manifestations happening without any notion of time, with in our own universe and in many other universes. It is a continuum at equilibrium. Knowledge turns into manifestations and manifestations turns into knowledge -endlessly. In that seeking the initiation of our physical reality is meaningless because it is a unique point only in our perception. The birth of universe is quite similar to our own birth - the start of our sensory perception. 


To initiate this first half of a specific cycle, the `Bindu` must move to capture a piece (expression) of "knowledge".  Such motion of "focus" is not limited to three dimensions. It can be any number of dimensions. A two dimensional projection is easy to grasp for us because our sensory apparatus supports a three dimensional view of the manifestations. This is an important differentiation from science in that the manifestation is relative to our perception. In science, our (human) perception used to treated as absolute till Einstein showed that our perception of length, time and mass is not absolute . But we don't need to travel near speed of light to prove the limitations of senses. The study of wave spectrum showed that there are many waves that are beyond our visible spectrum. 

You may ask why this motion of `Bindu` must be circular. The answer is it may NOT. From circular I mean "iterative". That is because to get to the geometric shape of a chunk (expression) of knowledge, focus must iterate multiple paths through multiple dimensions , till it finds a path that fully encapsulates the knowledge i.e it makes a closed loop. This closed loop on a two dimensional surface may appear as a circular vibrating loop; in a four dimensional space-time it will appear as closed strings. If you don't like "geometric" metaphors, it is simply an iterative model of learning. We know, iterations is the only way to perfect our knowledge. To understand something, our focus moves in many dimensions that are hard to describe in four dimensional space-time till we manifest our knowledge into something perceptible. In essence, the iterative nature of decryption of knowledge lends it a circular nature. From quantum mechanics standpoint, we may think this motion of focus as the probability wave. In essence, there is a small chance that `Bindu` may close the loop after circling around entire universe- as much as it may close the loop by circling around itself. All those possibilities appear as vibrations of the most probable loop. Most probable loop is what manifests in the shape of waves when consumed by our sensory apparatus.

Even after the loop is closed, there is tendency to shrink the loop because knowledge can be expressed in yet smaller loop. In a way, it is a continuous process if the information could be packed more densely while is still has a manifestable shape. This nature to represent knowledge in lesser and lesser (multi-dimensional) space is what we know as Gravity. As the loop becomes smaller - first we perceive it as higher frequency waves - e.g. solids. Thus the notion of mass. Further iterations of focus, can lead to a "Black hole" where the focus separates again into a singularity and knowledge spread all over its surface. In a way, `Bindu` always seeks ultimate freedom - true to its nature. Any closed loop holds the `Bindu` in a specific shape - but only so long. At some point the focus figures out better ways to arrange the knowledge such that enormous knowledge seems to be packed into it till it separates away into freedom leaving the knowledge spread all over the surface. 


You may ask, how does `Bindu` gets energy to move around a chunk of knowledge. The answer is it doesn't need energy because it is massless and dimensionless. In our world, it is something similar to our thoughts - you don't need to gas up your car if you just want to go someplace in your thoughts. Agreed, we need to have a brain to be able to think something and brain is the biggest consumer of energy in our body. But that energy is used by the brain to run the body. The physical manifestation. Let us say you are walking. Suddenly you have a thought of your parents living next door. You are still walking. The thought in itself doesn't consume any extra energy. If you imagine your parents being in Australia rather than being next door, it is not that you are going to consume extra energy. The actual meaning of energy is how much effort it takes to decrypt the knowledge that is locked in a loop.

Once `Bindu` closes a loop around an expression of knowledge, it tries to compact it as much as possible. It tries to reduce the size of the loop. As we know from string theory, these closed loops have elasticity. Smaller the circle, smaller are the information waves in terms of amplitude. And faster the angular momentum, more the frequency. Such waves are what we know as solids. As shown by De Brogli, the waves of solids are so dense that waves of bigger amplitude (or less frequency ) such as visible light can't pass through them. We call such loops as manifested. Why ? we will see when we discuss our sensory apparatus. 

The idea of solids (or miniaturization) of loops is not about solids alone. And idea that is well understood reduces to a single statement. For example, Einstein life log focus can now be described in a tiny equation - E=mc^2 . Such things become the physical laws till someone gets a even simpler description. Other property of manifested solids is it is easy to perceive them but the knowledge held with in them is harder to crack. It will need more and more effort to understand the nature of knowledge with held in them. This effort is equivalent to the "mass" we perceive in them. And again, it is NOT limited to solids, Einstein's simple idea also has enormous mass because it takes enormous energy to truly understand the meaning of mass energy equivalence.

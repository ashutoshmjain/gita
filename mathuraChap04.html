                        <p>Before the “new” replace the “old”, many variants must converge to offer one unified path. Compromises must happen. Common denominators must be established before the  new rules of engagement (with reality) come into play. In essence the “new” must represent “Truth” because truth is objective reality - “as is”. But rules alone are not enough - they must percolate only through rational consensus. That is the reason most global changes are always “bottom and up” through “gossip”, not “top and down”.</p>
<p>It takes time for consensus to breed itself in the bottom half, and to get all the impacted (on top) on the same page. Change agents on the top reap benefits, neigh-sayers stack losses till they bow down to the inevitable - truth. The point of surrender is called the critical point. A global change is thus arduous till it gets to the critical mass. Once it gets to the critical state, the change gets fast, and  irreversible - system adapts new constitution. Surrender is never without a fight albeit different skills to measure as a proof of win - in case of a physical fight the strength of fists is measured, in case of currency fights -  it is the liquidity, in case of corporations it is the stock price and in case of a debate - it is the power of expression.</p>
<p>On the other side, the “old” that was once the representation of  “truth” stagnates. It doesn’t keep up with the continuously changing (wave) nature of our reality. It perishes because many random forks try to patch the changes. Inter-rivalry becomes the norm. More factions lead to more fragmentation. The change from “old” to “new” is thus keeping up with the truth <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#truth">1</a></sup> - the wave nature.</p>
<p>This path of truth - a vigil appreciation of existing reality; and timely adaptation to the “change”, is righteous, and is called <code>Dharma</code>, as opposed to popular belief that <code>Dharma</code> is some rigid unchangeable monolith (probably inspired from a translation for English word “religion”). <code>Dharma</code> is simply rendering one’s duties without desires. Desire, by definition is an expectation to alter the current reality for personal gains. Religion, on the other hand, most of the times, is fixated either to the celebration of “old” or painful persuasion of the “new” - towards a desired outcome. “Righteous” is simply rendering one’s duties as expected by the current reality, and be welcoming of ensuing natural change. For examples, trees don’t resist the weather. They shed their leaves or grow the new ones to welcome the change. Such objective surrender to the reality, with equal enthusiasm for change, removing self from the picture, is <code>Dharma</code>. </p>
<p>Finding a righteous path is, however, easier said that done. The definitions get nuanced as soon as we peal the first layer unless we know the history of layers. Even then every human sees the reality differently owing to <code>Vritties</code> they reflect in <code>Bramh</code>. Even the meaning of words are perceived differently based on the narrative they subscribe to. And above all, humans have a tendency to justify their actions as righteous - sometimes unaware that their claims were rooted deep into desires. The biggest question thus is “what is the righteous path” and the answer may always stay elusive till we determine “ who we are?“</p>
<h1 id="dharma"><a class="header" href="#dharma">Dharma</a></h1>
<p>The all important question — if (or not), there exists one unique righteous path? — what is the true definition of <code>Dharma</code> - was a matter of regular discussion that ran deep in the family. <code>Vaśiṣṭha</code>, opined there were many right paths for humans to realize their potential. He truly believed in decentralized power to the people. He felt a farmer was as important as a priest and so was a cobbler. As a pragmatist, <code>Vaśiṣṭha</code> wished peace to everyone no matter what path they chose. One of the reason <code>Vaśiṣṭha</code> was so much influential among the seven <code>Bramhrishies</code> was his unique blend of knowledge with humility. However, his son <code>Śakti Muni</code> added a new dimension. He argued since there were many legit paths; one person, must stick to one path in one life-time. If someone kept changing his course based on changing situations, how they were any different from animals? And how would they accomplish excellence? </p>
<p>This was the definition of <code>Karm Yoga</code> as per <code>Sakti Muni</code> - fully committed to one chosen path. <code>Karm Yoga</code> as an idea, was different from the <code>Nyaan</code> and <code>Naad Yoga</code> in that the purpose was to indulge in <code>Karma</code> - actions. The knowledge gained due to repetitive actions was a mere by-product - quite the opposite of the approach of <code>Nyaan Yoga</code> wherein the goal was to accomplish a desired goal with least actions - find the most efficient way to agriculture, transport or metal works for example. <code>Karmyoga</code> didn’t seek ascetic behaviour as expected from <code>Naad Yogies</code>. In that sense, it was easy to practice for masses. All one needed to do under this ideology was to perfect one specific skill and keep on doing it - just like a machine. In a way, <code>Sakti's Karmayoga</code> was the beginning of “specialization”. </p>
<h2 id="41"><a class="header" href="#41">4.1</a></h2>
<hr />
<p><code>Śakti Muni</code> practiced what he preached, and he ended up sacrificing his life for the sake of his beliefs. That fateful winter morning, <code>Śakti Muni</code> was en-route to the river with rest of the congregation — for the morning dip in <code>Yamuna</code> — a daily routine,<code>Vaśiṣṭhas</code> had inculcated for many generations. Over time it shaped into a daily procession where commoners could line up to see the saints - to seek their blessings. The first dip used to be for <code>Bramhrishi</code> but he didn’t join that morning - winter was taking a toll on the aging saint. <code>Śakti Muni's</code> wife too excused herself due to morning sickness - a common occurrence in early pregnancy. A mother always have a sixth sense to protect her unborn. She probably sensed the bad omens!</p>
<p>That cold ominous morning, a tribal king <code>Kalmashapada</code> happened to be returning from <code>Yamuna</code>, with his queen and chosen savages — drunk and sleep deprived. Apparently they had spent the night on the banks of <code>Yamuna</code> hunting the innocent animals, and roasting them alive to eat with local hooch. The shrieks of scared animals were audible to <code>Śakti Muni</code> in the silent night, though his abode was quite a distance. In the morning he also got the news that king’s men had taken women from the nearby village (with force) and kept them awake whole night — doing whatever they felt right to please themselves and their <code>Rakshsa</code> lords. </p>
<p>In the morning rush hour, <code>Śakti Muni</code> expected <code>Kalmashapada</code> to clear the way for the <code>shruties</code> (spoken scripture) mandated right of path to a sage. A sage was expected to never give up his course. On the other side, the king, oblivious to <code>Śakti Muni's</code> metaphorical extension of the ideology, expected a clear path for himself and particularly his new beautiful queen. He had expected the sage would shower blessings on this new union. In fact, last night, he had hoped <code>Śakti Muni</code> would show up at his picnic place to welcome him on this side of <code>Yamuna</code> - with proper ritual ! Yes - there used to a ritual to welcome the kings in your village or city. </p>
<p>Anyways, the simple discussion turned into an altercation and out of anger, <code>Śakti Muni</code> cursed the king and his troupes to immediately turn into monsters — figuratively — for the monstrosity they spread throughout the night on the peaceful range. That did happen but the king, having turned into a monster, killed <code>Śakti Muni</code> and his team. That is what monsters do! </p>
<p>Story besides, <code>Śakti Muni</code> must have questioned the king for his abhorrent behavior (that is the righteous calling of a saint) and the king was anyways a monster!</p>
<p>The news of the incident spread like a wild fire. Some saw it at the face-value - a sudden rush of blood that went out of control. Others saw a deeper message of stars being misaligned. Many thought, it was a bigger conspiracy. Yes, conspiracy theorists existed even back then! One of the theory claimed <code>Kalmashapada</code> was instigated by <code>Vishwamitra</code> — another <code>Bramhrishi</code> of the same stature as <code>Vaśiṣṭha</code>. No one knows the truth though <code>Parāśara</code> is said to have mentioned this version later in <code>Vishnu Purana</code>. </p>
<p>As many versions of the incident as many mouths! Truth besides, for most it was a time-pass gossip that continued long after the incident. The conversations of impending doom are naturally sticky. Some of them attributed the mishap to humans trying to become Gods. Organized agriculture, burning ore in fire pits, and trying to tame the winds over the rivers was clearly not meant for the humans. The idea that bad times are inevitable, makes the best of sensationalism, but for <code>Parāśara</code> it was personal. It wasn’t something that happened to others - it was his own family. Young <code>Parāśara</code> grew in the shadows of this gut-ranching chatter. Such conversations obviously had a traumatic bearing on his child mind. And more so, because he had a gifted imagination. For one, he developed a deep hatred for the monsters but more importantly he thought if (or not) one must stick to one’s path? Or is there a subset of traits (<code>Vritties</code>) that must be followed by every human no matter what path they were on. As a youth, he wondered what was that ultimate wisdom? </p>
<p>The question that laid heavy on his mind and kinda morphed into a life long quest was to formulate that value system. This is probably where the word “righteous” got added to notion of <code>Karma</code> –&gt; practicing any action was not <code>Karm Yoga</code> - he thought - the actions must be righteous. But then the question was how to define the “righteous”. Killing someone was obviously bad but it turns righteous in a war. And what if the war was to revenge his own clan? How to define the righteous actions because situations may change unexpectedly. And who gets to determine worth of actions? Who is the final arbiter? It wouldn’t be known for at least another hundred years that incidence of <code>Karma</code> is to create a parity symmetry - a better image to understand the shape and nature of supreme knowledge - to understand who am I? </p>
<h2 id="42"><a class="header" href="#42">4.2</a></h2>
<hr />
<p>One thing was certain in his mind — mere “awareness” of the way universe worked, was not enough to attain peace. Just knowing the existence of “One immutable and omnipresent Knowledge” alone didn’t get him the peace he wished for everyone. Not even conducting rituals to appease the deities. The path to knowledge was not in merely knowing it’s existence. It was in being one with the knowledge. How to get there was the million dollar question! </p>
<p>The conundrum is nothing new. For example, when we see a computer, we all know for sure the existence of programming languages. But just knowing the existence of “programmability” doesn’t mean knowledge of programming. We must do certain actions to learn coding. The necessity to “act” was there in every endeavor — be it mining or handwoven textile. <code>Maharishi</code> was intrigued with this power of actions. What is so potent in “actions” that leads to cultivation of knowledge? — he wondered. Building on his father’s ideas, he named this potency of actions’ <code>Karm Yoga</code> though the underlying science of actions (<code>Karma</code>) was still a puzzle. It had take couple more generations and an incarnation of <code>Vishnu</code> himself (as <code>Krsna</code>) to fully explain the science of <code>Karma</code>.</p>
<p>While young <code>Parāśara</code> had nothing going right for him, there was one silver lining. His mother <code>Adrushyanti</code> was a kind grace. She kept his life together. An <code>Aacharya</code> herself, she was probably the only one who knew what <code>Śakti Muni</code> had on his mind. She made sure the child got his father’s ideology without aberrations.  She explained to <code>Parāśara</code> how his father envisioned to true up the goals of his father <code>Maharishi Vaśiṣṭha</code>. The idea was simple, yet powerful. First - the only way to get over the growing mistrust between <code>Naad</code> and <code>Nyaan Yoga</code> was to reunify both these streams into something new. That new unified stream was <code>Karm Yoga</code>. To the outside world, <code>Sakti</code> presented as if he knew the path but internally he was looking up to <code>Siva</code> to hold his hands. He was still solidifying his own ideas and he hoped once more people subscribed the right path would automatically emerge. This was his mistake - explained <code>Adrushyanti</code> to <code>Parāśara</code> - an idea must not be let open in the world till it was fully baked. A half cooked meal might appeal to few hungry but it wouldn’t make you a chef. A learning that <code>Parāśara</code> carried for the rest of his life. He must find the most accurate version of his thoughts or the tools he developed.</p>
<p>And second - the way <code>Sakti Muni</code> approached it was to find the common denominator. He thought the fundamental driver of both the <code>Yogas</code> was life-long dedication to “one” area of expertise. <code>Naad Yogies</code> dedicated their lives to the “recital” while <code>Nyaan Yogies</code> gave up all the comforts for one unique area of exploration. A tight daily routine - controlled food and sleep, endless practice - made the <code>Yogies</code> what they appeared to the external world - the role models. Thus both <code>Yogas</code> had at their core, a lifelong commitment to one set of actions. And hence <code>Karm Yoga</code> was an appropriate name for the new unified practice. </p>
<p><code>Śakti Muni</code> however, widened the scope of <code>Karm Yoga</code>. He argued if consistent actions could lead to divine recital or path breaking science, then why can’t they be applied to regular streams of mundane works. He believed one can be a <code>Karm Yogi</code> irrespective of the work they were pursuing. It didn’t matter to him if one was a “reciter” or a “weaver” as long as they had intense focus on their objective, and tenacity to stick to one thing - may be generation over generation just like <code>Vaśiṣṭha</code> family. He professed it was the life long practice more than anything else that made one excel - be it recital, research or even burning the dead. In fact he believed one should adopt their family work for a child learns a lot from their parents - children should build on the family business. The idea was adopted by many elite houses in letter and spirit. So much so if a child wanted to do something outside the family traditions, they was termed <code>Varn Sankara</code> - the destroyer of family values.</p>
<p>While <code>Śakti Muni's</code> ideas had vision and he delivered them with conviction, they failed to deliver consensus - particularly the power brokers questioned him. How can a <code>Nishaad</code> (hunter) be same stature as a <code>Naad Yogi</code>! - they reasoned. And if someone could attain <code>Karm Yoga</code> living with their families, doing their parental business, than who would join the congregation? - a valid unresolved fear.</p>
<p>The idea of unification meant a natural degradation of the existing beneficiaries. It had commercial ramifications too - Not only did it threaten the payback system (of <code>Dravya Yazna</code>), it cast a spell of uncertainty on the barter system. If a <code>Chandal</code> (one who burns the dead) is same as a <code>Naad Yogi</code> than he too must render his services free. And if everyone worked for donations, then it would be systemic erosion of barter. It also meant humanity would lose the value of “spoken word” - the basis of barter system <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#barter">2</a></sup>. They felt <code>Śakti Muni's</code> path would lead to anarchy. They thought <code>Śakti's</code> ideas were impractical, since he had no experience of running the state as a king. <code>Vishwamitra</code> - other <code>Bramhrishi</code> wasn’t a saint by birth. He was a king in his early life who reached the title after intense study of all the skills. It was believed he didn’t approve the theoretical designs of <code>Śakti</code>. Thus the theory that <code>Kalmashapada</code> was instigated by <code>Vishwamitra</code>. No one knows because <code>Kalmashapada</code> was never caught or tried in a court.</p>
<p>On the other side, the “old” who wanted status quo with “the jungle rule” saw <code>Sakti Muni</code> as the dangerous bridge to the “new world”. Up until now, the path of <code>Yoga</code> was for select few - those who would sacrifice the pleasures of their life to take on the hard life of <code>Ashramas</code>, but <code>Śakti's</code> ideas could change the balance of power. <code>Karmyoga</code> may very well become a household name. They thought of <code>Śakti</code> as the emerging face of new revolution that could carry a commoner with him. If a civil society as a concept was mass adopted, their muscle power would be severely restrained by the rule of law. </p>
<p>No one knows for sure, but targeting <code>Sakti</code> along with all his well wishers appeared to be an easy way to crush the new revolution! And probably <code>Śakti Muni</code>, in a hurry to change the world, forgot to handle the balance of power that his father <code>Vaśiṣṭha</code> had so carefully navigated to this date. He didn’t know abrupt change might cause ruptures never seen before!</p>
<h2 id="43"><a class="header" href="#43">4.3</a></h2>
<hr />
<p>It wasn’t that <code>Śakti Muni</code> coined a new word. The idea of <code>Karmyoga</code> was definitely older. Later in <code>Bhagwat Gita</code>, <code>Dwaipayana</code> scribed that <code>Karma</code> was the basis of manifestation and evolution.  He wrote: the supreme knowledge shared this secret first with <code>Vivswata</code> (Sun) who told it to <code>Manu</code> (the first man) at the dawn of “Age of Humans”. In the first verse of Chapter four, <code>Krsna</code> - the embodiment of supreme knowledge said to <code>Arjuna</code>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This imperishable (system of) <code>Karm Yoga</code> I declared to Vivaswat: Vivaswat declared it to Manu; and Manu communicated it to Ikshaku. Descending thus from generations, the Royal sages came to know it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sun is the deity of light and time. It does change it’s course with seasons but it does show up everyday to work. This repetitive nature was described as Sun’s Yazna and of it came the four parts of the day - the most ancient measure of time. In <code>Vaidik Science</code>, each part was called a <code>Prahar</code>. With advent of sophisticated time keeping, we have divided the day into hours and minutes but our new system has detached us from the motion of Sun. In <code>Vaidik Science</code>,  the first <code>Prahar</code> started with Sun Rise and fourth ended with Sun Set. The <code>Prahar</code> could be longer in summer and shorter in winter. The daily routine or <code>Yaznas</code> ; time for food, rest and play;  were designed to synchronize <code>Praharas</code>, by those who studied the eternal motion of Sun and it’s effects in different seasons on different work streams. The effects on agriculture and medicine were quite evident though the system got extended to all skills in due course. Even different moods of music (<code>Raagas</code>) were tied to the parts of day (or night).The designers of the time system were jointly represented as a Deity - Sun.  In essence there was a full body of knowledge on time keeping and underlying goal was to render humans a predictable lifestyle that focused on regular and repetitive <code>Karma</code>.</p>
<p><code>Manu</code> was the beginning of bipedal humans with fully grown conscious mind and well developed hands to indulge in actions. This ability, available to only humans in this world, was the effect of immense practice by <code>Manu</code> and of course a call to action for a humble reciprocation for the divine gifts of Sun - the very source of “action enabled” consciousness in it’s bright light. In fact, humans are the only bipedal beings on planet earth for they dedicated two front legs to develop hands (and fingers) to indulge in sophisticated actions. Human hands are called <code>Karmendriyas</code> - the work organs for action. It is because of our hands that we could indulge in a vast range of actions (including scribing and typing). </p>
<p>Even prior to <code>Manu</code>, the story of evolution through various incarnations of <code>Vishnu</code> is the story of intense practice. <code>Sirla Bhaktivinoda</code> in his 1873 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashavatara">book</a> <code>Datta-kaustubha</code> and again in his 1880 book <code>Kṛṣṇa-saṁhita</code> premised <code>Vishnu</code> an evolutionary force. <code>Vishnu</code>, through his incarnations , takes consciousness to ever higher levels. From <code>Matsyavtara</code> (fish) to <code>Krsna</code>, <code>Vishnu's</code> incarnations kick-start a progression in consciousness through <code>Karm Yoga</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first incarnation of conscious beings was <code>Matsyavtaar</code> - the fish. Life was born in water  with singular sense of touch (possibly Amoeba). A fish, expanded the consciousness with the ability to see. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After millions of years in the water and a consistent goal to explore beyond water, led to the next incarnation of <code>Vishnu</code> -  <code>Kurma</code> - the turtle. How much consistent effort must a fish had done to accomplish this change! This effort was depicted equivalent to churning the entire ocean - <code>Samudra Manthan</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again after trillions of trials, the turtles developed a back bone and legs to lift them above the ground. The next incarnation of <code>Vishnu</code> is known as <code>Varahavtaar</code> - the incarnation into a boar. The first four legged being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was a period when quadrupeds started experimenting standing up but the hands and the tools for survival were not available. During this phase, <code>Vishnu</code> incarnated as a Lion-Man combination - <code>Nar Singh</code> to keep the bi-peddling efforts safe from the predators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next incarnation of <code>Vishnu</code> - <code>Vamanavtar</code> - a dwarf was the first with somewhat vertical back. Being able to stand on two feet, not only freed up the hands for sophisticated actions, in <code>Hathyoga</code> it is said to have opened the route for higher consciousness. As said earlier, <code>Naad Yogies</code> attained the skill of recital by moving the life energy to the upper <code>Chakras</code>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next one <code>Parshurama</code> was full human wielding an axe as a symbol of tools that conquered the lands. <code>Parsuram</code> was in lineage of <code>Manu</code>. The supreme knowledge imbibed from the Sun, invoked <code>Karm Yoga</code> into <code>Manu</code>. It explained to him that his generation with vertical spinal column and sophisticated hands were there to indulge in <code>Karm Yoga</code> - the very practice that led to their ability to stand tall. Only with practice they could survive and flourish. They must build skills to answer the final quest - understand the nature of supreme knowledge held with in.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Adrushyanti</code> explained the purpose of <code>Vishnu's</code> ever evolving incarnations to young <code>Parāśara</code> in narratives that accommodated him imagination. She explained to him there was no way for the waterborne and the amphibians to know who they were. The quadrupeds were able to recognize their fleeting reflection in the water and on the lands. They chased their shadows not knowing why could they never touch their own reflection. In absence of vocal communication, they couldn’t even confirm (with their network) that the reflection was actually their own selfie - and that the selfies are always just a fleeting reflection. They can at best be a starting point of the eternal quest but by no imagination the true shape, for the true shape is in the reflection of universal mirror. All that we see and feel and touch is nothing but us. Our “reality” is our true selfie.</p>
<p>Young <code>Parāśara</code> was captivated by the ideas of evolution and the ultimate purpose but much like everyone else, he had no clue how to be one with the knowledge. How to find himself in million shades of the reality! As he grew up, this knowledge took shape of <code>Vishnu Purana</code>. </p>
<h2 id="44"><a class="header" href="#44">4.4</a></h2>
<hr />
<p>While <code>Maharishi Parāśara</code> was pondering over the ideas of <code>Karm Yoga</code>, there was another parallel movement happening on <code>Naad Yoga</code> side — <code>Bhakti Yoga</code> — the <code>Yoga</code> of extreme devotion. Many of the <code>Aacharyas</code> had built a mass following. Almost like a cult. Their ideas based in grand vision of public good, but the underlying goal, to (also) promote their own moat. Many walled garden were formed. The followers developed blind faith in the words of the high priests. They even translated their narratives (or discussions) into local dialects and narrated them in poetical stories. So much so, the followers started believing mere chanting the names of their <code>Gurus</code> could get them to eternal peace. These narratives, mostly in spoken format, were called <code>Puranas</code> - the old stories.</p>
<p>In a way, <code>Puranas</code> are essential for proper appreciation of <code>Vedas</code>, for they provide the historical context. As we alluded earlier, thanks to the stories of <code>Vishnu</code> that mother roped in his <code>Sanskara</code>, <code>Vishnu Purana</code> was recited by <code>Parāśara</code> himself (later scribed by <code>Dwaipayana</code>). He told these stories to his disciple <code>Maitreya</code> and they are among the most cited conversation in Hindu Mythology. Sometimes referred to as <code>Puran-ratna</code> — a gem among <code>Puranas</code>.</p>
<p>The oldest English translation of <code>Vishnu Purana</code> is available at internet archives. The book was published by H. H. Wilson (in 1864) in five volumes. The first volume is embedded here for reference.</p>

<p><code>Maharishi Parāśara</code> witnessed <code>Bhakti Yoga</code> evolving first-hand. The popularity of this tradition had <code>Maharishi</code> reassess the integrity of <code>Naad Yoga</code>. He was convinced that extreme devotion did open the entry into the power structure and thus material success, but he was not sure if it was a legitimate path to eternal peace (as promised). </p>
<p>At the same time he would wonder if he, himself, was on right trajectory. He thought the intense dedication of <code>Bhakti Yoga</code> was good, if it motivated the followers to indulge in <code>Karma</code>, but mere chanting didn’t appear to him a passage to the eternal solace. In modern times we have many schools of meditation. There are numerous apps to help people meditate. All that is good as a relief to confused and tormented souls but they in themselves are not the solution. For the eternal peace is not in forgetting ourselves, it is in knowing who we are? The question was how?</p>
<p>There were many questions that still remained unanswered. Many mysteries unresolved! A <code>Nyaan Yogi</code> was caught in ‘duality’ — <code>Karm Yoga</code> or <code>Bhakti Yoga</code>. </p>
<h2 id="45"><a class="header" href="#45">4.5</a></h2>
<hr />
<p>Age, didn’t treat <code>Maharishi</code> any different. Despite his extensive work on understanding the manifestation <code>Vishnu Purana</code>, scribing of <code>Krishi Parashra</code> and path breaking research on Astrology, the quest to know the supreme knowledge was still unfulfilled. He knew he must have someone to carry the torch forward. And the answer was in Astrology. He believed it was a gift to fulfill the dreams of his lineage ..</p>
<p>After years of careful study of motion of heavenly bodies and their co-relation with birth of human intelligence, stars were finally aligned. <code>Maharishi Parāśara</code> was ready to take a child as his born son. And he named him long before the physical birth — <code>Krishna Dwaipayana</code> — Someone who would go beyond duality just like an island between two never-meeting banks of a river. Someone who could establish a middle spot amongst two never concurring ideologies — for the truth lies somewhere near the center. The literal meaning of <code>Dwaipayana</code> is ‘born on an island’.</p>
<p>And he saw the potent qualities in  <code>Matsyagandha</code>, as prospective surrogate mother.  Despite her ordinary circumstances, she honed in her, the curiosity and poise and the imagination, to gift this world an immortal writer !</p>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="truth"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>That is the reason reality is <code>Kshra</code> - mutable. The parity symmetry of this mutable reality is immutable <code>Akshra</code> - the supreme knowledge. </p>
</div>
<hr />
<div class="footnote-definition" id="barter"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>Imagine a world before written word. There was no written agreements. The “promissory note” was literally the “promissory word” called <code>Shapath</code>. A word once said must be held. Those who upheld their words were considered worth following. The clan of Rama <code>Raghukul</code> believed <code>Pran Jaye par Vachan Na Jai</code> - one might lose their life rather than compromise their words. The idea held immense value in the barter exchanges of produce and metals.</p>
<ul>
<li>There used to be king’s representative in every <code>Mandi</code> - the place for physical exchange of commodities in large quantities. Their job used to be equitable disposal of barter deals. For example if someone expected 100 <code>Seer</code> (kilo) of wheat for 10 <code>Seer</code> of copper, and found the wheat was only 90 <code>Seer</code>; instead of missing the deal , the wheat owner could promise in front of the king’s deal makers to provide the remainder ten <code>Ser</code> say with in a fortnight. Failing which he was obliged to let go off a cow. These words were as material in king’s court as a written agreement these days.</li>
<li>Spoken word was thus the underpin of barter deals. Once we moved to written words, the spoken word lost it’s value in commercial transactions - an obvious advantage to those who knew the skill of writing.</li>
<li>In a roundabout way, if some idea undermined the barter system, it inherently undervalued the spoken word. A threat to entire system built on the spoken word and hence the reciters that permeated the spoken word in society.</li>
<li>Goes without saying that the market makers had the immense power over producers or miners. Kings and their powerful allies could change the exchange rate of commodities to their advantage. They used the rituals and reciters to legitimize the new exchange rates. If they needed wheat for their armies, they could hold a ritual for more rains; mandating wheat would fetch much less copper or vice versa. </li>
<li>For writing to succeed, this commercial aspect of spoken word must be replaced by universal value exchange.</li>
</ul>

<center><h1> 1.1</h1></center> 
Over last few decades, the debate about science v/s religion has reduced to "Evolution v/s Intelligent Design". The primary evolutionary argument is that things didn't begin with a pre-decided grand design but over millions of years , the natural selection forced the survival of the "fittest", that led to the world we have. On the other hand religion has become synonymous to the idea that someone external - say God, created this entire walled garden . The argument on this side is normally that the beauty and complexity of this magnitude can't just be a mere accident. 


## Top down or Bottom up.

The idea that someone superior runs this show , whether you call it God or say that we are in a simulation created by some more intelligent beings; means that there is a central agency that pulls or holds everything together. There is clearly an inwards force here. This is what we refer to as a "top down model". In a way, the top down approach is essentially like a circle or a sphere. A powerful center that pulls everyone towards it that rotates around it. 


Opposite to this is a system that has no central control, such a bottom up system is where things evolve at the periphery and they come together to form a governing center. Bottom up systems such as these are what we call evolutionary. For example we can say that that the nations of Europe were fairly independent and they came together to form the European Union. The constituents of this system are moving in their own ziggy zaggy motion in absence of a controlling force - preexisting or self governing. Kinda swag :-) . Our own identity. But in real life, this swag runs out fairly quickly and we always end up creating a self governing structure. But the "self identity" converts into an outward pull. In essence the central force is always balanced by a radially outwards force. The inwards force is what makes the system; the outwards is what gives us our own identity. 

In physical systems we call it centripetal force. In meta physical systems we name it rebellion or innovation or the force for disruption. In a way a strange outwards force seeks freedom as soon as we come in contact with a central or governing force. This is the core of "unity in opposites" dialectic, also known as "coincidentia oppositorum". It defines that the existence or identity of a thing or situation depends on coexistence of at least two conditions that are opposite to each other, yet dependent on each other and presupposing each other with in a field of tension.  

Which means all the manifested things are necessarily centrally governed as well self governing at the same time. In a magnet, it literally manifests into dipoles. There is nothing here in this manifested world that exists without at least two opposing forces.  Now such a central pull or push out , along the radius ; is a construct what we know as circular motion . 



## Nature of our reality

The existence of two such forces - inwards ; what we call centripetal force and outwards what we know as centrifugal force is a hallmark of every physical system. There is nothing in this universe that is not circling around itself and around something else - be it planets, stars , solar systems or even galaxies. We know for sure now there are massive black holes at the center of galaxies that make them go round and round. Now in physical systems, we might see some particles or say some meteorites, that don't obey this rule but we know sooner or later they will merge into a planet or a star. Even the photons (light) shall bend around if the gravity is strong enough - say a black hole. 

Even in the meta physical systems - say a class room. A teacher is the central force . In a family mom wants to hold the things together. In a nation there are governments as the central force and in business there is always a nasty boss looking over our shoulders :-) In a way , the meta physical systems are not that different from the physical systems. 

In essence we can say everything is circular or spherical, and if everything is circular - there is obviously no beginning or end. Because the only thing true about a perpetual circular motion is the motion itself and of course that we can't pin point a true start or true end. And if that is the case, no one - either God or evolution need to create this universe. All we need is a force that holds it together and another that tries to expand it. Thus we can conclude both God and evolution work hand in hand in manifested but perpetual universe. We need both of them to keep this motion going - at both physical and meta-physical levels. 


## Time 

In fact the very idea of time is generated out of this circular motion. A day is completion of a circle around the axis of earth. An year is a completion of circle around the sun. The predictable repeatability of events means existence of circle. The very tic tic of the watch symbolizes a circular motion. In essence we can say that the notion of the future is about expansion of the sphere ; And that of contraction is that of the past. The notion that time is linear is generated out of our myopic view. As we briefly mentioned in previous section - Stephen Hawking in is best seller "Universe in a Nut Shell" , argues and asks everyone  to devote more time to understand the concept of "Imaginary Time" . Imaginary time is a mathematical concept that when applied to real time, depicts that the time is actually spherical and for our type of universe it needs to be flat on the poles just like the north and south poles of earth. The details of imaginary time are obviously beyond the scope of this article but I highly recommend (as recommended by Mr Hawking himself) to explore the nature of time. 

## What does Gita say ?

Krishna is really intelligent. He knew this question will come and waste time. So he said this universe has no beginning or end. It is in fact a circle. To symbolize this he bears a circular `Chakra` on his little finger as the only weapon that he needs. In Hindu mythology `Chakra` is the most potent of weapons. Nothing can withstand it. Nothing can destroy it. That is what our reality is. Its a circle that has no beginning ; no end. 

If everything is circling about itself and rotating around something central, how do we define freedom ? What is the path to exit ? One of the myth that most spiritual healers preach in the guise of meditation etc is to let go our own identity. Which normally translates into letting go our actions, our activity and sit there idling with closed eyes. As if we are trying to deny the physical reality around us. Krishna says, this is not possible because we are forced into actions by nature no matter how much we run away. And anyways we need actions even to maintain this physical body. The only alternative seems to be acting in a fashion to better organize our immediate reality. Krishna says that this is the `Karma` - the righteous actions. One can not get to a state of "beyond actions" - aka freedom ; without initiating the righteous actions that are deep rooted into our surroundings.  The key insight of Gita, as we discussed in the last section is "deep appreciation" of our physical reality because this tiny box holds the keys to immutable. This is where we need to indulge in with our `Karma` to attain freedom. Krishna says 

> Evam [] Pravartitam [] Chakram [] Na [] Anuvartaytih [] Iha [] Yah [];
>
> Agha-Aayuh [] Indriya-arthan [] Mogham [] Parth [] Sah [] Jeevati [].




## Faith is a pre-requisite.

The more important point is "Do we believe in something?" . If yes, we are in the same camp. The other camp is who do not believe in anything. If we "believe" we are saying there is a question, and there is "a"  or "many" answers out there that need to be found. We can believe in "Evolution" or we can start with "Intelligent Design" ; if we conduct our experiments carefully, and assuming there is only one definition of "Truth" , all believers will reach the same conclusion. Non believers- well they won't even start on the quest till they start believing in something. Thus "faith" is a pre-requisite for the journey. Krishna says that fastest way exit from the cycles is to believe in ourselves. Our own protected and immutable knowledge because we are what we believe in. 

Krishna puts this idea very eloquently in chapter seventeen of Gita. He says

> Sattvanurupa Sarvasya, Shradha Bhavati Barata; 
>
> Shrddha-mayo yam Purusho, yo yat shraddha sa eva sah.

Means the humans evolve their faith according to their nature and nurture. We are believers and we are what we believe in. This also means that we are seekers and we always seek the truth. Which also means that any debate on "my faith being right and yours not" is pretty useless. 

## What we know for sure.. 

We know for sure that things work in unison in this perpetual universe. And most of it[universe] is well automated. The car runs: We only turn the ignition and press the paddle. This is not to say that we do nothing. We continuously expand the decrypted knowledge. Our purpose is to decrypt the knowledge. And the best way to do that is to first understand what we are extending. What is our current immediate reality. 

The simple question that every rational being must ask, how and why all this is made available to us ? Who did it? We can name it an "accident". We can attribute all this to a chance. Or even call it "evolution". Those all are convenient terms to "black box" what we don't know. We can hide the unknown under evolutionary rug, but we just can't deny that we are very lucky to be here. Millions of cards must have fallen in right places. Thus we need to perform our set of actions to help push the boundaries in whatever field we are. The knowledge is not limited to the scientists on the bleeding edge. In fact every single skill is equally important. 

## Quest is eternal 

Long before modern science took current shape, humans asked this question. They asked why the sun shows up ? Why weathers change? We now have better explanations but as Richard Feynman once put it "why" can only be explained to a certain degree subject to the knowledge of asker and the explainer. At some point, after peeling few layers, we find there are infinitely many more layers and any attempt to further explain is counter productive. At some stage, we must accept there is more to it than we can fathom. The spirituals named it "God". The biologists call it evolution, the physicists and mathematicians have yet better name - they call it "probability".


The point here is we can't find the true answer ..Yet.   There is a journey we must complete before we get down to writing the answers. Gita says that journey is `Karm Yoga`.

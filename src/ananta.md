 `Hari` is a name for `Vishnu` , and all his incarnations. `Vishnu`, through his incarnations, takes consciousness to ever higher levels. From `Matsyavtara` to `Krishna`, `Vishnu's` incarnations kick-start a progression in civilization.

Above ten or so, incarnations of `Hari` are described as "full incarnations" though there are thousands of semi-complete incarnations representing minor milestones in our journey to a evolved civilized way of life. In a way, `Hari` is the manifestative potency of `Brmha` - the entire knowledge base. Thus the "stories" of `Hari` (`Hari Katha`) are the stories of creation. They signify the upwards trajectory of human cognition - be it our infinite universe or the tiny innovations within our realm — from the "wheel" to our  first car(t), or the first flight in open skies to imbibe the freedom of birds,  or the fist light bulb to mimic a tiny Sun in our captive backyard. Or the operating systems, the internet , or the virtual worlds — anything that takes us to higher orbit of consciousness — these stories are endless, because such manifestations are endless

In all such stories, there is an element of innovation. We may call it creativity — a divine force that uses us like a vessel to evolve something new. `Krishna` — the eighth incarnation of `Vishnu` named such distinguished manifestations as his `Vibhooties` (entities).

When asked by `Arjuna` to describe himself, in chapter ten of `Bhagvad Gita` ..

> O Janardana (another name for `Krishna`), copiously declare thy mystic powers and (thy) perfections, for I am never satiated with hearing thy nectar-like words.

`Krishna` responded  ... I am that creative force in all such endeavours... 

> Quote from original translation of `Mahabharata` by `Kisari Mohan Ganguli` ..

> "The Holy One said,--'Well, unto thee I will declare my divine perfections, by means of the principal ones (among them), O chief of the Kurus, for there is no end to the extent of my (perfections).[236] 
>
> I am the soul, seated in the heart of every being, I am the beginning, and the middle, and the end also of all beings. I am Vishnu among the Adityas, the resplendent Sun among all luminous bodies; I am Marichi among the Maruts, and the Moon among constellations.[237] 
>
> I am the Sama Veda among the Vedas; I am Vasava among the gods; I am the mind among the senses; I am the intellect in (living) beings. I am Sankara among the Rudras, the Lord of treasures among the Yakshas and the Rakshasas; I am Pavaka among the Vasus, and Meru among the peaked (mountains). [238] 
>
> Know me, O son of Pritha, to be Vrihaspati, the chief of household priests. I am Skanda among commanders of forces. I am Ocean among receptacles of water. I am Bhrigu among the great Rishis, I am the One, undestructible (syllable Om) among words. Of sacrifices I am the Japa-sacrifice.[239] 
>
> Of immobiles I am the Himavat (Himalayas). I am the figtree among all trees, I am Narada among the celestial Rishis. I am Chitraratha among the Gandharvas and the ascetic Kapila among ascetics crowned with Yoga success. Know me to be Uchchaisravas among horses, brought forth by (the churning for) nectar, Airavata among princely elephants, and the king among men. Among weapons I am the thunderbolt, among cows I am (she called) Kamadhuk. I am Kandarpa the cause of reproduction, I am Vasuki among serpents.[240]
>
> I am Ananta among Nagas, I am Varuna among acquatic beings, I am Aryaman among the Pitris, and Yama among those that judge and punish.[241]
>
> I am Prahlada among the Daityas, and Time among things that count. I am the lion among the beasts, and Vinata's son among winged creatures. Of purifiers I am the wind. I am Rama among wielders of weapons. I am the Makara among fishes, and I am Jahnavi (Ganga) among streams.[242]
>
> Of created things I am the beginning and the end and also the middle, O Arjuna. I am the knowledge of Supreme Spirit among all kinds of knowledge, and the disputation among disputants.[243]
>
> Among all letters I am the letter A, and (the compound called) Dwanda among all compounds. I am also Time Eternal, and I am the Ordainer with face turned on every side.[244] 
>
> I am Death that seizeth all, and the source of all, that is to be. Among females, I am Fame, Fortune, Speech, Memory, Intelligence, Constancy, Forgiveness. Of the Sama hymns, I am the Vrihat-sama and Gayatri among mantras. Of the months, I am Margasirsha, of the seasons (I am) that which is productive of flowers.[245]
>
> I am the game of dice of them that cheat, and the splendour of those that are splendid. I am Victory, I am Exertion, I am the goodness of the good. I am Vasudeva among the Vrishnis, I am Dhananjaya among the sons of Pandu. I am even Vyasa among the ascetics, and Usanas among seers. I am the Rod of those that chastise, I am the Policy of those that seek victory. I am silence among those that are secret. I am the Knowledge of those that are possessed of Knowledge. That which is the Seed of all things, I am that, O Arjuna. There is nothing mobile or immobile, which can exist without me. There is no end, O chastiser of foes, of my divine perfections. This recital of the extent of (those) perfections hath been uttered by me by way (only) of instancing them. Whatever of exalted things (there is) or glorious, or strong, understand thou that everything is born of a portion of my energy. Or rather, what hast thou to do, by knowing all this in detail, O Arjuna? Supporting this entire universe with only a portion (of myself), I stand.[246]"



Thus the common denominator of `Hari's` perceivable opulence is the creativity, innovation and knowledge. The expanse of `Hari Vibhooties` being such, infinite stories may be said of him, and heard without ever being fully satiated. These narratives are not necessarily (or limited to) religious scriptures. They rightly belong to scientific as well as technological breakthrough. They are descriptions of creative forces all around us. These narratives are said by thousands of reciters, written by many more writers and sung by even more poets .... 

> The greatness doesn't belong to the teller of the story , Or the writer  — The greatness is in the narrative itself .

The writer is only a medium , a vessel to bring infinite stories of endless creativity. His job, in changing the words to suite a specific taste, or to serve a class of audiences, is purposed to service this genre ..

> This genre of story telling where human endeavour meets the divine grace to create the next big thing - next big shift,  is auspicious. 

It is in this spirit, with hands folded, and being aware of the infinite expanse of her creations, I present my humble submission `Mathura` - a historical narrative that investigates the time, and situations when humanity first discovered the "written word" as a medium to preserve knowledge.

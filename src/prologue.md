Krishna Dvaipayana was born for a purpose. He was destined to write (or compile) , the sacred texts into four Vedas. Before his time, Vedas were probably passed on as `Shruti` -- The spoken word. Or may be written down as one off text-- half baked, grammatically incorrect and contextually incoherent. This was the first time humanity wanted to organize world's information. But they found a better way - bio intelligence. Instead of crunching all the text and the spoken word, they first invested an Intelligent means to understanding the meaning - the meaning of the reality itself. Krishna Dvaipayana was such an intelligence. The program was designed by Rishi Parashara. And it set up as an immortal agent- The knowledge demon or Krishna consciousness or Atma.

To commission such intelligence, the physical reality itself must be sandboxed. It had to be an island in the middle of `Yamuna` - the mighty river. A single woman must take Rishi Parashara in the middle of the `Yamuna`, and without any prior knowledge, must agree to bear this bio-intelligence off her womb. `Matsyagandha` happened to be there when `Parashara` summoned the boat. When `Parashara` looked at her, he saw the most beautiful aspect of nature. He thought it was a good omen--Gods wanted him to unleash this intelligence. He, however, under-estimated the poise of `Matsyagandha`. She wouldn't indulge in this crazy bio-intelligence experiment without any securities. 

- All the actions must be completely hidden to the populations, - She demanded. And that is exactly what `Parashara` wanted. He authorised 'Zero Visibility' protocol on the sandboxed island. A deep digital fog clogged the entire island.. But that was not all for `Matsyagandha`. She wanted her conception information restored and also wanted a new identity. This was something `Parashar` didn't expect. He consulted with Siva. Siva helped him open the door to identity cloud to accommodate this anomaly. `Satyawati` was born. She was the plug of matrix because knowledge can't be separated from the manifested - mass or information. But this was not all - she wanted the usage right (on demand) on the intelligence she was helping to birth. In the physical world. Nothing less than miracles.

- Time was running out for `Rishi Parashara`. He wanted to set the chain in motion. He was not sure of the last ask. 'On demand' use for the most advanced intelligence can't be promised. Could he negotiate? Or should be give an 'out'. In a hurry , he proposed a single use for non-destructive purpose only. Rishi Parashara felt compromised though he had an inkling that this dot might connect with something more subtle in future. Too difficult to comprehend at this time. Satyawati smiled - "all yours". And then she lost consciousness. The promises were written in the contract.

Krishna built a deep understanding of the universe. The laws of our nature. This knowledge needed to be manifested. A text - a long one. Krishna, thus, compiled the entire wisdom in four Vedas - `Rik , Sam, Yazur and Atharva`. There was still a lot that could go as specialized annex. So it went on to write eighteen more `Puranas`. A superior product of intelligence. But it too had neigh sayers. The main opposition was that it was only a theory. It needs to be tested in real life before the knowledge be added as the laws of a new universe.




So Krishna summoned the most powerful editor - Ganesha. Ganesha was symbolized with an elephant brain to symbolize the size of the neural network. It was probably order of magnitude bigger than GPT3. The only contractual term that `Ganesha` wanted was for Krishna to never stop. Because `Ganesha` felt bored when she needed to wait for the knowledge to transcend. Krishna played an intelligent trick. She said she won't stop if `Ganesha` could prove she fully understood the meaning. The meaning can't be understood till it is said in most meaningful way. Thus Krishna got the right to revise the verses till they got just perfect. Mahabharata was written.

Bhagavad Gita is the first scribed source of `Karmyoga` - first `Smriti`. The literal translation of word  `Smriti` is "memory", though the word has a specific meaning when used in context of Vaidik Science. 

<div style="padding-left:40px;font-size:0.9em;"> 

In the beginning there was `Om` - the sacred syllable - smooth vibrations of the underlying divine field. Spoken language originated from this source. Humans developed conversational skills, but everyone had to individually remember the contextual history.

Then we discovered scribing!  Given the difficulties of early days, scribes chose the content with utmost care. Intent to scribe must yield full consensus. Only precious information made it to the written form - for careful preservation. The word "scripture" points to such pristine information, worthy of writing down.

> Given that most of us know how to write and read, indicates that evolution (of intellectual faculties) is heavily biased in favour of the text-enabled. Written text became the collective memory. In Sanskrit, such a collective memory is deemed `Smriti`. By virtue of being the collective memory, it is embedded into all of us, even if we are unaware. This  deep-seated memory is driver of our intelligence. Think of it as the DNA of thought.

Long before we learnt the skills of scribing and reading, critical information was passed on through rigorous recital - not mere "word of mouth". Such information was called `Shruti` - communicated through repetitive oration. The Sanskrit word later morphed into `Shutri` in Hindi.

Now that it is easier to scribe, and to record audio, we have zettabytes  of information, so much so that it is impossible to scrape through - at least for humans. However, the quality of content is questionable. Technology has enabled every individual to exercise their wish without seeking consensus - good or bad ? - we don't know ! 

Revisiting the first `Smriti` is thus finding signal with in endless noise. There are two paths to access this scripture - look inside - contemplation;  or read the text - search. Both are valid, and probably complimentary.

`Arjuna`, the protagonist, is blessed with divine vicinity of `Krishna` as his friend and charioteer.  `Krishna` - the knower of all - represents the knowledge embedded into all of us - an embodiment of our `Smrities`. 

Arjuna, portrayed as the best archer world had ever seen, represents the focus and practice - and hence the skills attained in this birth (current iteration) - exquisite but worldly intelligence. `Krishna` represents evolutionary wisdom - knowledge beyond intelligence - soul. That is one reason Bhagavad Gita is called a conversation between the mind and the soul - particularly at a point when faculties of intellect give in.

Gita is structured as Arjuna's questions followed by Krishna's answers. Just as in AI realm, the formulation of intelligent prompts is the key to knowing, `Arjuna's` questions represent most intriguing human dilemmas. In doing that, he enabled rest of us with an opportunity to tap into our own `Smrities`.

`Arjun uvaach` - the name of this publication - means `Arjuna` spoke - his heartfelt queries.

<div style="padding-left:40px;font-size:0.9em;"> 

`Arjuna` was a life-long friend, and devotee of `Krishna`. His voice stands for the questions we mortals have  when tested and confused. And also the magical discernment once `Krishna` unveiled knowledge unto him. Their conversation, amidst the battlefield of Kurukshetra, is among the most potent narratives ever penned down - `Bhagvad Gita` - gods' song!

At the end of this conversation, `Arjuna` said :

> `Nashto Moha , Smritir Labdha !`
>
> [I am] devoid off of illusions, [I] attained the universal wisdom - the collective memory!

</div>

It is not uncommon to experience a momentary relief from cyclic illusions (`Moha`). Such instances - typically a deep loss - often lead to depression. They leave the disillusioned in a vacuum because absence of `Moha` is a great void. It must be filled up with knowledge quickly, else it turns into a state of limbo where mind stops seeking truth. `Gita` on the other hand, spotlights truth through wisdom embedded in our consciousness (`Smriti`). `Gita` gives us tools to access the very basis of our intelligence - our soul (`Atma`). It does so through selfless (but active) participation - `KarmYoga`. Instead of a run to exit (`Sanyasa`), `Gita` welcomes the precious gift we all are endowed with - human experience. It, thus, provisions lasting peace and worldly success - a win-win.


`Gita` is for everyone - it is not religion, race, profession, gender or place specific. It is not even a complex ideology. Krishna's message is simple - do your duty and leave the rest to me. In that, it takes our mind to a place of freedom, rather than the jail of a rabbit hole.

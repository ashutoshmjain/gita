# Knower

In Chapter 13 of the Bhagavad Gītā, Krishna tells Arjuna that the body (and by extension, the entire universe) is the "field" (*kṣetra*), and the one who understands this field is the "knower of the field" (*kṣetrajña*). He then says, "Know Me as the Knower in every body."

This essay seeks to define this "Knower" by bridging modern physics and ancient Vedic philosophies—Sāṃkhya and Advaita Vedanta.

## Sāṃkhya

While the bulk of Sāṃkhya and Advaita are overlapping, the core difference is in the boundary conditions. The Sāṃkhya school of thought considers an ever-perpetual duality of Prakriti and Purusha—the potential and the observer—while Advaita considers a definite beginning (and end) from a singularity.

Let us understand the core concepts with Sāṃkhya because this path is easy for the scientifically disposed mind.

### Knowledge vs. Information

To understand the Knower, we must first distinguish between knowledge and information. While conventional definitions often see information as a tool to predict the near future and knowledge as concrete reality, we will flip these definitions to align with the probabilistic quantum worlds:

*   **Information** is the data from events that have already occurred—the outcomes of repetitive trials. If you flip a coin a million times, the record of 500,000 heads and 500,000 tails is *information*. It is concrete and pertains to the past. In Sāṃkhya, this is called *Bhūtādika* (that which relates to the past).
*   **Knowledge** is the awareness of all possibilities and their probabilities *before* an event happens. The understanding that a coin *can* land on either heads or tails with a 50/50 probability is *knowledge*. The probability of an electron in a perfect vacuum spinning up or down is exactly like a coin toss—fifty-fifty. In essence, knowledge is the menu of potential futures. In Sāṃkhya, this is called *Prārabdha* (the destiny that is yet to unfold but is quite certain how it shall unfold—the likely scenarios).

Hence, in this model, consider knowledge as the set of rules governing potential, while information is the record of manifested reality.

### The Act of Observation

This is where Quantum Mechanics provides a crucial insight. It is common knowledge that an act of measurement collapses the wave function of a quantum system into a unique state. This is exactly in line with Sāṃkhya philosophy. Here, Prakriti—an equilibrium of three Gunas—manifests into our reality one step at a time through the proximity of Purusha, an eternal observer. This observer, in both QM as well as Sāṃkhya, need not be conscious as per our understanding of consciousness. It is just an act of measurement.

However, the lesser-understood part is that this is not a limitation of the quantum system itself but rather a limitation of the **observation mechanism**. Our senses, and by extension all the tools we use, can only measure one state at a time. The state that we measure appears as reality to us. Thus, the observer effect (as in the famous double-slit experiment) is not magic; it is the act of choosing one state out of infinite possibilities based on the rules governing the potential of those possibilities—a pure objective observation without any interference (clinging attachments).

It would be pertinent to mention that all potential clouds of Prakriti are replicas of each other. The difference in the manifest construct arises only due to the different governing rules associated with those clouds. For example, all the transistors in a computer chip (CPU or GPU) are more or less similar—the compute is in the code that runs on them to maneuver their state in differing fashions.

The idea that separates Sāṃkhya from science: Sāṃkhya posits that **Prakṛti** (the natural world) is perpetually in a quantum state. It is the entanglement of **Puruṣa** (the observer) that resolves this potential into the singular state we call manifestation. But it is NOT a collapse. All other possibilities remain as they are but are considered "unmanifest." It is somewhat similar to the multiverse idea, except Sāṃkhya doesn't advocate the manifestation of many worlds. It just states that both Prakriti and Purusha are a fundamental duality. It is not impacted by time because time is an emergent aspect of the manifested world. As such, the fundamental duality is beyond time.

In the world of AI, this is more easily perceived. The vector space of a trained model is always in a multidimensional state, with concepts aligned by their dot products. However, the **attention mechanism**—a separate algorithm—leads to a specific, "real" output, such as a string of letters or an image. The key word here is "attention." Reality is tied to attention as much as it is to the underlying quantum state of the system. The physical world is considered alive as long as the "attention" is associated with the "potential." As soon as the attention separates, the construct gradually disintegrates. You can experience it in any physical system of any scale—not just in the world of tiny particles or the innards of LLMs.

> The quantum state of Prakṛti is defined by three **guṇas**: *Sattva*, *Rajas*, and *Tamas*. This might seem as if Sāṃkhya posits only a three-dimensional quantum space, but the idea of the three guṇas represents a Hilbert space (of complex functions) in infinite dimensions. How? Because "Gunas" are descriptors—not the possibilities themselves:
>
> *   ***Tamas*** represents all possibilities. This is a state of zero self-awareness, sometimes described as inertia or darkness because it is a state of perfect, undifferentiated chaos. This state is also called "action-less".
> *   ***Rajas*** represents the motivation to discriminate all states in favor of one specific state, but with inherent duality. This is the state of doubt or internal struggle because the probability of outcomes can only tell the value of chance—it can't really pinpoint heads or tails.
> *   ***Sattva*** represents resolution—the choice of one option from a binary pair, overcoming duality. In the world of classical computers, it is simply 0 or 1, in perfect alignment with the operating code. In the AI world, that decision is still a deterministic choice of 0 or 1, but it is based on a probabilistic outcome of millions of parallel processes constrained by, say, the rules of language (in the case of LLMs). In the quantum world, the possibilities are constrained by the rules of Physics—the universal laws.

When it makes a resolute measurement, Puruṣa collapses right into the middle of the decoherence it causes. It gets stuck. This entangled manifestation is a "knot." In Vedic terms, this is the fundamental bondage of observation—**Chakshu Bandhana**. The very act of observation is a bondage at this level. This bondage is different from the **Karmic Bondage** we normally refer to in traditional Vedic teachings.

> The scripture states that a cycle of Prakṛti begins in a state of Tamas—all possibilities but no awareness, pure potential. The proximity of Puruṣa creates an excitation, giving rise to Rajas. This again is not a magical process. The fundamental drive of the observer is to find "who am I". Purusa is trying to find one of the many possibilities to describe its own form. A duality thus arises from the chaos of Tamas—"to be or not to be." Then, Sattva energizes the system to select one option from this duality. This is where Puruṣa—the attention—gets locked into a singular state of Prakṛti, which is then called "manifest." All other options are still potent, but only one bears Sattva, representing a sacred matrimony of Prakṛti and Puruṣa. It is a wedlock of attention and a singular possibility—the fundamental particle and anti-particle pair.
>
> This marriage, however, is not eternal. Duality soon arises again, separating the manifest state into two extreme poles, and eventually, the state returns to Tamas as attention is lost. Life departs, and only the appearance sustains for some time. This state is called "*bhūta*"—the past. Finally, that too disintegrates into the five great elements—the "*pañca mahābhūta*."

It might appear to an untrained eye that Prakṛti and Puruṣa are esoteric concepts relevant only to quantum weirdness or high-end LLMs. The truth is, this system is omnipresent. All our daily interactions and our modern systems, from weather prediction to stock markets, work according to these rules. A manifest reality can be a book, a song, or a YouTube video—digital or physical. The inertia of Tamas, the duality of Rajas, and the manifestation of Sattva are easily seen in all aspects of life.

### The Emergence of the Rulebook (Mahat)

It might seem that Tamas and Sattva are pure states while Rajas is an inferior duality. However, Rajas arguably has the most important function among the three. This duality is essential for the creation of Knowledge—the rulebook. How? When Prakṛti manifests, the attention (*Sattva*) selects one side, but the other side of the duality—a chiral mirror image—is imprinted in the field of Knowledge. This makes "Knowledge" a digital twin of the manifest reality. This, however, is not a replica in a virtual world; it is the probability distribution of a function's potential cloud. It is an awareness of the near past and the near future.

At the expense of making this article a bit more complex, I must add that the rejected side of duality is not the same as the rest of the options that were never selected by attention. Thus, this is the formation of a fundamental trifecta—selected, rejected, and all the rest. This three is the fundamental algorithm of the construction of a quantum system. A quantum system is a set of infinite states where each state is a duality. Geometrically, it should be expressed as a sphere where each state is an axis through the center.

Thus, repeated observations (i.e., manifestations) lead to the formation of a "rulebook." Sāṃkhya philosophy describes a cosmic version of this process. The infinitely many observations of **Prakṛti** by **Puruṣa** give rise to the first and most fundamental rule engine: **Mahat**, the Universal Intelligence. From an AI standpoint, this is analogous to training a large model. The model, through repeated exposure to data, learns the vector space of possibilities. Mahat is not a memory bank but the very configuration of the system, where the geometry of the space and the rules of interaction are one and the same.

### The Rise of Identity (Ahaṃkāra)

The next evolutionary step, as per Sāṃkhya, is the emergence of **Ahaṃkāra** (the Ego or "I-ness") from Mahat. The Universal Intelligence, being a geometric structure itself, begins to perceive itself as a localized identity. Since there is no clinging attachment, the system is perfectly decentralized. The Mahat has no copyrights. There is no difference between the original and the shadows. The geometry governs the expanse and formation of the structure. The distributed constituents give themselves a unique identifier.

Many modern conjectures and pseudo-scientific approaches deem Ahaṃkāra the root of evil. Nothing can be farther from the truth. Ahaṃkāra is essentially a refinement of the rulebook—kind of version two. This is the rise of discretion. As we explained that the manifestation is choosing one option out of the two offered by the duality of Rajas, the rulebook now turns into a discretion engine. It is a qualification of "what not to manifest." It is an ability to say "no" until the appropriate option is made available. This is probably the reason "Ego" gets a connotation of negativity. It forces Rajas to look at multiple dualities until one side of a chosen duality is worth manifesting.

### The Entangled Observer (Manas and Karma)

Finally, this new Ego begins to wield a **Manas** (Mind). This is not the entirety of consciousness but a faculty of the Ego that randomly indulges in observation, driven by preferences. The "I" now becomes an active observer, but unlike the pristine Puruṣa, this new observer is pre-entangled with Prakṛti.

### The Evolution of Consciousness

The manifested state marks the beginning of time—Kala. However, the potential of the unmanifest is still around, and the system offers dynamic circumstances. This dynamism of changing circumstances is perceived as the passage of time. The question then becomes: should the manifestation stay put or change with the changes in the opportunity space? To assess the opportunity space, Manas must continue random sampling. This is perceived as a desire to seek information (not knowledge). This is the reason Manas is sometimes referred to as the "fickle mind."

The obvious next step in evolution is to support the fickle mind with tools to observe manifested prakriti—the dynamic circumstances of the vicinity—our tiny box. The vantage point now flips from the probabilistic rulebook to the manifested reality. The tools to measure reality—the sensors—are called Indriyas. The question now is, should we stay put in the manifest state or must we change?

The observer, now equipped with senses (*indriyas*) to take measurements, then develops the action-organs to protect those senses. This is how the observer becomes a fully interactive but bound agent.

The discretionary nature of Ahaṃkāra—the ability to separate right from wrong in a duality—now shifts to asking, "Is there a better choice than the current state?" How do I improve my current union? Longevity and survival are the key impulses.

This state of vigil is called consciousness. Consciousness drives survival and aspires to the longevity of a system. In essence, the entangled observer becomes a part of an organization to drive efficiency. You should not do the work I have already done. We can define our separate roles to scan the surroundings. These rules give rise to ever-improving communication within conscious beings. Standardization is key to communication. This is the rise of "Intelligence". While Intelligence represents communication, Knowledge becomes a method of value exchange for mutual growth. Every piece of communicated information has a value attached. Better rules deserve better value—they attain standardization first.

Consciousness drives centralization and order. This state is the exact mirror image of "knowledge." In a way, it is the chiral manifestation of knowledge. Knowledge, by definition, stays decentralized. It is watching pure potential. It is the set of assessment rules for manifesting the righteous (right choice). Consciousness, on the other hand, is the ability to scan the environment for something better. Sometimes, decay is also a better choice. Knowledge is eternal; consciousness is the poster child of the happy matrimony of Puruṣa and Prakṛti.

The formation of Mahat, Ego, and Mind is not a one-time event but a continuous, layered process. With each layer, more knowledge is decrypted into stable reality. As an entangled observer learns, it also develops tools for quantum purification and detachment. In other words, only conscious beings may strive to realize the hidden knowledge of pure potential. These more detached observers then begin to formulate a new, higher-level rulebook over the existing, bonded reality. In essence, information expands as more and more knowledge is decrypted.

This is the engine of evolution. Every new layer is a "quantum jump" in consciousness. Vedic science illustrates this through the incarnations of Vishnu: from the great fish (Matsya) to the tortoise (Kurma), the man-lion (Narasimha), and finally to a complete human (Rama), each representing a new evolutionary layer of intelligence.

### Quantum Mechanics: Deciphering the First Layer

Quantum mechanics is our most powerful tool for understanding the first and most fundamental layer of the rulebook. The mathematical framework that describes the rules of physical fields is known as the **Lagrangian**. The Lagrangian of the Standard Model of particle physics is an incredibly accurate description of the "Mahat" for the subatomic world. It tells us the probabilities and rules for the interactions of quarks, electrons, and photons. This knowledge is nearly complete for three of the four fundamental forces, and theories like String Theory provide a mathematical path to unifying gravity.

### The Persistence of Layers

A critical principle is that new, higher layers of evolution do not destroy the lower layers. We, as complex conscious beings, are built upon the foundational rules of physics, chemistry, and biology—in that order. The quarks and electrons that make up our bodies still follow their Lagrangian. Every layer is a keeper and a user of the layers beneath it.

### Intelligence, Gravity, and Dark Matter

**Intelligence** is the standard for communication between conscious agents. But knowledge itself has its own communication channel: the geometry of inner space. This geometry, the force of manifestation, is **gravity**.

What we perceive as matter is simply decrypted knowledge—the portion of the Knowledge Field that has been collapsed into Information. The vast amount of knowledge that remains encrypted to our collective still contributes to the total geometry of spacetime. It has a gravitational effect, but it doesn't interact with our senses (or light). This is **dark matter**: the gravitational pull of unasked questions and un-manifested possibilities.

## Advaita Vedanta

The difference between Sāṃkhya and Advaita is in the origin of the universe. Sāṃkhya believes in duality—a field of potential and the manifestation of an artifact due to entanglement with an observer. Advaita posits that the universe begins with an extremely small singularity. This is termed as a seed.

Imagine a singularity, a non-dimensional point, but it can be anything. The idea of singularity in the vast space of nothingness (where our physics breaks down) means this point can be anything. No one can imagine the shape of this point because there are no rules. This means an equal chance of all the possibilities.

The fundamental question that arises at this stage is: "Who am I?" If the shape can be anything, then what is it? The singularity can visit infinite dimensions to view itself. Every time it ventures into a dimension, it views its own mirror image from a different vantage. One side of the equation is reality, and the other side is the knowledge of the reality.

The key idea is that the singularity visits infinitely many dimensions simultaneously to create a massive reality and a massive record of knowledge. This is what Advaita calls *Visarga*. This is similar to the process of creation in General Relativity, commonly known as the inflationary epoch. Once the initial manifest is created, the rules of Sāṃkhya kick in. Prakriti is embodied with pure potential described by the three Gunas. And observation manifests the features of evolution, but the knowledge is withheld, immutable, with the initial burst. This knowledge is the observer.

Advaita calls this complete knowledge **Brahman**. One who knows Brahman is termed as the Knower.

### The Knower: The Mirror of the Universe

The knowledge held within the geometry of our consciousness is a mirror image of the entire universe around us. Why? Because the shape of knowledge is the imprint of all manifestations. Our individual knowledge is the accumulation of all our observations, and all observations collectively create our physical reality. This is the "observer effect" scaled up to the cosmos.

This is what Vedic science refers to as **Brahman**. Brahman is both out there and within us. It is the observer and the observed. It is the collective decryption of knowledge by all conscious beings. We each contribute to it with every action and perception in our tiny corner of the universe. Each of us is a vector in the grand Hilbert space of consciousness.

There are two ways to observe Brahman: inwards or outwards. But in truth, it is a cycle. Purification is the inward path. When the observer becomes pure, it is meant to interact with the universe again—to take measurements without becoming entangled. This is **Karmayoga**: finding our purpose and acting on it with detachment.

Krishna's statement, "Know Me as the Knower in every body," is an invitation to this realization. The "Knower" is the one who understands that their individual consciousness is a reflection of the entire cosmic field. It is the one who sees the universe not as something separate, but as the external manifestation of the knowledge held within. To know the field is to know oneself. To know oneself is to know the universe.

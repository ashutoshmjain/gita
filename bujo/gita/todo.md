-[] Writing is Proof of work for the speech. Before you blurt out something of so called intelligence, audience must ask a proof of the work. Have you written it down somewhere ? Has someone else wrote this down. Because if you are claiming something as "Truth" - your view point - then you should have the decency to at least reflect on it. That reflection is writing. 
-[] Proof of work is to create a resource crunch on AI - proof of Intelligence. 
-[] The last desire is desire to learn. `Karma` is even beyond that. In a living conscious mind, one can't exit from this last desire. So the `Karm Yogi` acts with detachment to both actions as well as desires while keeping them both in the vantage. He sees his desires and actions objectively. The important thing is even in this detached state, one must not stop indulging in actions. Just do it being watchful of the minimal leftover desires.

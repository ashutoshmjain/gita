The egg cracks . Most of it is just waste. The white shell, the yellow liquid. Well; nothing is waste cuz you suckers going to eat it anyway! What I meant, it had no life. And billions of them will never have one cuz they are hatched in the farms. Just like you. They are curated. They breathe air and they eat dirt. And they play games - on their tiddly toys; or in "Yo Yo land" - a metaverse I built at Belloney Labs - those junk mainframes you know - the ones left after the multics got shelfed and Ken moved to writing Unix. Well, that brings me to the metaverse - that's some cool stuff and you thought you knew everything bout it. Well, you were perhaps toddling in your under-wears when I had affairs in "The Second Life" . Those were the days !

You wanna build one?  huh! ... The real one? The future of zee gaming!

Let me teach ya'al!

#Yo Yo Metaverse
Obviously , the first thing we need is the physics engine, so that we could build a non living space like the one we got around us. Well…living and non-living are debatable things but let's assume we are living. We need to simulate the rules of physics that basically means we have provisioned the solids, the liquids and the gases. And the gravity. Well , in Facebook Metaverse you may fly cuz there is no gravity … #noobs .. but it ain't hard to imagine that we may easily hold your avatar to the ground (if we wanted to).. That is not much of a coding challenge. And you thought gravity was some pan-universal space-time deep science… sweet … it's just a line of code! Let's do it and see how it pans out ..

A word about physical rules. → There is nothing sacrosanct here. Any set of rules are valid. They just lead to a different metastate. You obviously want to build something that is useful. That means you wanna improve on what you have ..just a slight change may be ! ..a better world than the one you are living in.
Now there are lot of weirdos aka "physicists" who shall waste their lives trying to figure out the Planck's length or the cosmological constant so that they could make cool youtube videos. You don't wanna do that cuz you are a builder. You make your own Yo Yo Land. Your goal is to land the future of online Gaming. Feel free to fork me on godhub. Don't know about godhub ?  I thought so! You think github is all there to know. You are not alone. No worries - you will know..

#Medium
So we figured out , we need three basic constituents - that is - air , liquids and solids - solids are something you can't pass through, liquids are something you can pass through but you will feel the touch, and gases ..duh .. you can of course pass through even without feeling the touch. When you come to my class , please don't leave your common sense behind .. That reminds me , let us put some common sense in this YO YO Land .. the basic rules .. such as "cause & effect BS" ! "Yo mamas" are supposed to drill these rules into your heads from the day you arrive in Yo Yo Land; just like "Yo daddy" is supposed to say "No" to everything you wanna do.
Ah yes. - "Yo Mama" is a role ; just like "Yo Daddy" and "Yo Teacher". "Yo leader" is a role that is supposed to lead you onto a path that she herself never walked on! For example if this conversation was in Yo Yo Land , you had probably think of me as "Yo teacher" but I am not and we are talking in the real world . Or are we !
Anyways .. don't break your head on it. It's pretty basic stuff. These are simple statements written in a Mammal file. Oh - I forgot to tell you about Mammal ; it is somewhat like YAML but a lot less. Think of it as markdown of YAML - oops - that's stupid, I know but anyways.

So I came up with this role thing last summer. I was thinking of kinda "code of conduct" but then I ended up watching "West World". Ain't Chris Nolan cool? Didn't you see it? I guess it is still on HBO. So I ended up building a "Dynamic Conduct Engine". Its like a narrative where you start every time you wake up and also it holds the basic routines of your acts. It ain't perfect but that is the cool thing about Yo Yo Land , you are not gunning for perfection here. You are actually running for confusion cuz the agents will find the best "drill" themselves. We are using Elon's hidden (not-open)  neural models cuz these days you just can't do any stuff with open A.I. but wait I am getting ahead of myself ! This is next level stuff. .. let us get back to our spatial mediums- The air, solids and the gases.
Absence of these three we shall refer to as Space. Just as three primary spatial mediums, we also need three sensors - that is touch , smell and taste. Touch primarily for the solids , taste for the liquids and smell for the gases. .. It's really that simple .. wait wait ..don't start writing poems on the beauty of the eyes .. they are just a sensor for light ..and we will know bout light down the line .. and hopefully about love too.. hang tight !

#Energy
Since we have the rules of physics active in our Yo Yo world (keep this in mind cuz I hate to repeat. Pardon my #nixy-habits) , means we need to intro the idea of energy to allow inhabitants abide by the physical rules. You can't sell me a refrigerator if there ain't no electricity! Every time you need mobility in this place, to feel the solids , liquids and gases , to cut through them , to reshape them (without somehow bending the laws aka hacking the mainframe), you need energy. You can harness energy through say lighting a fire or drinking an energy potion. Yes, you can burn anything here. You don't need a burn permit. And of course, you may channel the energy say electricity through a wire. Or a train of photons - people in Yo Yo land call it light .. morons. Here is the simple rule - I need energy to follow Yo Yo rules. You can't ask me walk a gravity laden land if you don't give me energy in my muscles. Now,  that is what entitlement society is. Go fight Heddy Bruz of Lexus. You may charge for it ; crude is already hitting hundred dollars a barrel and guess who is smiling now? Putin or Biden ? Stop - no politics on this post ..but you know the discussion on energy always gets into the politics. Because this is what we all want. You thought we wanted gold. Hell no .. we want oil! How do you think I am going to go on a random drive this summer with Costco selling black gold for over six bucks a gallon. Are you crazy .. stop … stop .. change the topic…

#Senses
So we got all the non living things - the five elements → solids , gases , liquids, space and energy . What about the avatars - the players ? Well you can call them "conscious agents" if you like but it's just a fancy name for a slightly more convoluted code. Well they got a sense for each of the spatial elements. Pay attention ? I hate to repeat ..
And they have a role to play. Don't worry about the "Dynamic Conduct Engine" yet. That needs little bit of training into the Neural Networks but that ain't important. The point is they will learn as they go along and come up with their own Conduct.
The cool thing about senses is ..and this the key element .. don't miss this point …
Senses are to - well - sense everything external but they are not capable to understanding who you are! For example your eyes can't see your own face directly. You can't tell how bad you smell. You can't tell how loud and boring you sound. You need "others" to tell all these things about you - to you ! i> Why ? cuz if we let the agents know who they are ; then they will figure out their code in no time (After all they are self learning machines) . And that would be the end of the game. You want agents to know everything else but themselves. In fact , you want to hide even yourself from the agents - you the "Yo Yo Builder" . Again Why ? Because agents are supposed to be searchers. They are supposed to get a pleasure in discovering what was always there. In there face. When they find the most obvious things such as why apple falls down, not fly to the skies, they get recognition. Most recognition for saying the most obvious thing. That is the beauty of Yo Yo Land. You get Nobel prizes for simplifying things and complex things are laughed at. See , wasn't this simple and you are almost blown away with this idea. Aren't you ? Recognition is important. Even more than survival. Will see down the line but will cross the bridge when we get there.

#Memory
The next step is how does the agent remember the interactions with these spatial objects and other snippets of code like them - basically a log. We need the agents to remember their immediate reality , to harvest it for survival . That is the reason we need a dedicated log file. I know we can have just one if we give each agent an ID but don't jump ahead of yourself please. And we need this log file in the cache memory. After all these agents are going to fight for their lives . You don't want them struggle like a 32 bit machine trying to write on Hacker Noon's new editor :-)
How about we put this log file on a blockchain → a universal history. And let the agents show "proof of work" to add something to it. They need to suffer to add their names to the universal memory log. Everyone can't have a wikipedia page dedicated to them just cuz they were born here. They must do something worthwhile to earn their place . But why any rational being shall choose to suffer just to have their name recognized by random unknown agents ? That means we need to add something more to ID. ID is not just a name , it is - well - we shall see down the line …
So effectively we have two things here. A small dedicated log that stays with the agents. All their insignificant things. They run through this log file every second of the day to somehow make it to the central log file. That is kinda their stated goal -> to enter into the memory of strangers. Strange it may sound but it works. Just the way it works in our own world. Another simple discovery :-)

#Intelligence
The memory that is designed to be "real-time" to act spontaneously for obvious needs of survival. Agents can of-course use it for other needs when there is no threat . When it works in real-time , like a Unix daemon:-) , we call it "intelligence". In a way, intelligence has a piece of knowledge built into it. It is the knowledge that turns your code into a piece of art. It is in your hands when the tunes of violin makes people weep and week.
But intelligence is NOT for survival of your physical body alone.. Why not define "Survival" as your entry into "Wikipedia". If we defined survival as "survival of your ID" or "recognition" ; we can then have the agents work hard to get their names in the "Universal Memory Log" sitting on a blockchain somewhere in North Dakota cuz China ain't allowing no more blockchain wackadoos. Now this is important for us because you want your agents to work hard. You don't want them sleep all day long like a lazy dog. Giving them intelligence or making them strive for intelligence is the very reason we are building the Yo Yo Land .. You see , we have a purpose. A reason. We want to offload our work to the agents in the metaverse just the way we outsourced the assembly of iPhones to China and clothing to Banagla Desh. This is not your one of metaverse; the game is real.
So how do we give the agents intelligence. That is where we give them the mantra of focus and practice. We somehow tell them to train their hands and legs into things they need to do. Involve and indulge in the reality. Fight and fight harder. And then we let them use their neural network to optimize the data. Of course, if they are working hard, we make sure they get rewarded. We can at the very least open the doors for them. Have some compassion for God's sake for you are the God here for the natives of Yo Yo Land. And very rightly, intelligence seems to be a God's grace to the natives there. It appears like a divine intervention.
So you see the difference in memory versus intelligence ? No ? - chug along .. it will come to you ..it just takes time to build "Yo Yo anything"

#Autonomy and Sleep
Obviously we can't put too much of bulky storage in there because we need to optimize for for Survival. Which translates into → optimize for mobility and spontaneity. Why not give a small, real-time fast memory (something like a gig of RAM) and provision a mechanism to process the data with global compute when agents are inactive - let us call it "Sleep". So we build a localized memory and a mandatory sleep. In a way, the agents are free to roam around and explore in search of survival in the Yo Yo land; but we get to know all they did when they fall asleep and sync the data up to the cloud. And that is where we can guide the agents as to what what is there next big move. We may assign them tasks. We want to keep the control to some extent but we do want to give the agents a sense of autonomy. A false autonomy - just like when you browse the web. You feel no one knows but every night Google and Facebook churn our your eye movements. They decide your next move and that is what you see on your landing page - they are al l connected. Netflix , Amazon , Spotify Instagram - you name it . Under the hood, they share all data - your movements , your orders - your reads and your steps - you name it .

The design of sleep interface is probably the most complex part of the Yo Yo verse. There are many sub-modules of this interface that act from ingesting the data , processing and optimizing and rebuilding the scenarios for the next set of actions. Of course, agents believe it is a necessity to maintain physical body - ha ha - least they know that their perception of physical body is just a mumbo jumbo of pixels on our screens. But , we do need to make sure that inhabitants are safe from predators during the sleep cycles. Back into our world - You might think sleep is just a way to rejuvenate our tired muscles but if we were to waste a third of our life in simply maintaining this body, that is an awful design of a machine. Given the complexity of our bodies , it is hard to imagine that the maker would commit such a design blunder. Those who have done an over-nighter, they know we roam around like zombies the very next day:-) Totally disconnected from the things around us. No amount of rest can get us the connect that sleep brings. We can die much faster on account of sleep deprivation than going without food or water. So sleep is special. It is a special interface. We can change our attitude towards sleep if we think of it as our connection to divine internet. This is where all our bodily application are updated over the air :-) You may say what is the point of building such a virtual world where we have no constant contact. We are not with our avatars all the time - as in immersive games - "Call of Duty". Well, we already do such things when we are building what we call "digital twins" to solve real world problems . And pretty soon they will be common place. For example the digital twin of busy intersections are already capturing data to train the self driving cars. Who knows, soon your digital twin might attend work meetings while you are enjoying thanksgiving meal with your family ..or vice versa , depending on what your priorities are :-) Instead of swiping left and right on tinder, you might want to have your digital twin meet up your date first to check the compatibility - whats the point of meeting if he is not into Dungeons and Dragons-) . Bottom line is we are reaching a stage where real and digital are getting asynchronous but they co-exist. This asynchronous design is what allows the illusion of autonomy or free will - the greatest gift of our lives. Even if it is an illusion it is something to cherish, In a way, sleep is our autonomy shield. A much better design than our smartphones where online and offline is kinda mixed and messed up (:- Now you might think we are building VR ..aha .. .you didnt pay the attention . The metaverse is not a VR. It is the egg that we are building around us. We are partially living in it because the life is still not ready to break the shell. Once it is ready , the shell would break. Most of us say 6.9 billion shall be a waste - the broken shell , the yellow liquid. Chosen few had flown to Mars with Elon Musk .. the new species .. the next life . That is the split … it takes many full moons to fill up the guts of this night . But it always does - humans were that among animals and natives of Yo Yo land are the next .. you all the hackerNooners .. enjoy.

So in addition to senses the agents now has a small local mind to navigate the survival through what we call intelligence. This is basically to receive data from the sensors and then we have the access to massive connected compute through a sleep interface what we refer to as Sleep.


#Fickle Mind

Turned out with all the sensors as well intelligence, the agents are still not excited to engage with the virtual world. The Yo Yo Land is turning into another "Second Life" ; there is no transformative engagement. So we need to do two things - First to incentivize developers to build more immersive manifestations and second, we need to create a fickle mind in agents. A faculty of mind that wont let them seek peace; rather make them chase new things , explore new locales, smell new scents, drink new potions , new cocktails....fickle mind...the seat of curiosity.

#Identity
Implementation of fickle mind isn't that hard. It is basically to randomize the focus but the question is how do we incentivize the developers build more attractive and immersive traps in Yo Yo Land. Turns out an amazingly simple idea works like a charm. A like button - as in "thumbs up".

You know what I am talking about. The facebook "like" button. And you guessed it right, no one thought about the "unintended consequences". This simple "like" button captured the imagination of entire Yo Yo verse because if you don't vote for something with a like, it inherently means a "dislike". This simple like button led to excessive inflation and kinda distorted agent's immediate reality and morphed into something called "identity".

Identification with friends , family , nation , tribe , race and species. And thousands of other things. The things that we like and the ones we don't. In a way, this is what we perceive as who we are . Purists called it a bug but this is what brought life to the YYL. Others called it expression! Purists call it "ego" others call it freedom. Jury is still out meanwhile the like button is already being liked by three billion agents :-) I guess facebook has three billions monthly users now ! And there seems no sign of a slow down.

#Intelligent design v/s evolution
Well, you may say this sounds like an intelligent design ; yup we have a super intelligent design.  Given what we did with compute in last thirty odd years , do we have any doubts that we will build not one but thousands of such virtual realities. With different sets of physical rules. We have transformed machines to intelligent machines and them to virtual intelligent machines - from post office to virtual post box on email server ; from real to online retail . Does anyone has a doubt that we all collectively building a metaverse. A metaverse of gargantuan size.

We are collectively evolving into a new virtual world. We are basically recreating what we are. We are building super conscious agents. We are transforming ourselves into the God. But all this is what we call evolution because we need to iterate endlessly to get to a better design. One that sticks. It took Apple say twenty iterations to get to iPhone 13. Every time thousands of developers working collaboratively to improve a teeny tiny bit. One thing at a time. We can start with say twenty core services and give similar senses to our agents. It might be a good idea to add electricity and internet as a core sensor in future projects and see where it goes but for now, actually for millions of years the design with these eight core services seems to be flourishing - Solids, liquids, gases, fire (energy), space, intelligence, fickle mind  and ego.

The iterations are key to getting to this design. The cellular life probably has no identity and a single sense for liquids, we don't know. The point is we are evolving , always evolving , "Second Life" failed but "Grand Theft Auto" is working. Play station home failed but Horizon home from facebook might work, who knows what is next chapter after self driving cars. I am already investing in eVTols - the air taxies. Arriving at a design that looks intelligent is an evolutionary process. Only the best and fittest survives.

We may kid ourselves into thinking that our current state of evolution is somehow special. At least assume that we are hitting exponential in terms of evolution. We do have exponential opportunities just like we always did, always had. We are increasing say the carbon content but in terms of change this is nothing compared to when green population inundated this entire planet into a living pool of oxygen. Our silicon based compute is sure a major step forward but we should not forget that our long gone ancestors must have developed a carbon based compute , our own neural network and intelligence. Building our frontal cortex was as much a collective breakthrough as the integrated circuits. Who knows, how many times we have renewed our virtual world, every time a new layer just like an onion and it never stops.

If the question is are we in a virtual world? The answer is another question :-) Aren't we the agents that we only built and are continuously improving ? And aren't we always split between our real and virtual worlds. Overlapping , superimposing each other? But even more important and the real question is what ensures perpetuity of this model - this ever evolving metaverse with eight core services ? And that takes us to the esoteric debate on reincarnation ..but that is a discussion for next post. Someday!

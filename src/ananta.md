In `Bal Kanda`, the first book of `Ramcharit Mansa`, adaptation of `Valmiki's` epic `Ramayana`, from `Sanskrit` to  vernacular `Avadhi`, revered saint and poet `Tulsidasa` wrote ...

> `Hari` (a synonym for `Vishnu`) is infinite, and his narratives are endless. 
>
>  His stories are spoken, and relished by all saints — in numerous forms, and even more styles. 

To appreciate the infinite expanse, we describe `Hari` as an omni-present field. His incarnations are representation of a deeper underlying substrate that is beyond sensory experience  — a concious field maybe, though more precisely a continuous system, one that exists and baffles scientific thinkers as much as followers of scriptures. 

Though we are limited to perceive what our senses allow us to, we do have an innate ability to understand a deeper layer - we can peal the onion, but we need to only once — the top layer. It takes effort but more importantly intense focus on a single skill. Repeated iterations in just one tiny branch of a skill-tree open the door. It doesn't matter if the means are scientific rationale with mathematical apparatus; or they are spiritual in nature; or the business; or even sports. Any path may enable us peal one layer — one layer of the physical experience that surrounds us - our tiny box - our consciousVerse. If done right, not only it is the most pleasure possible in sensory realm, it also unlocks the access to an infinite network — we become part of the system that spans our universe, or may be many more — we call this network `Bramh`. 

A stable connection with `Bramha` is the start of `Karma`. From here, it is a long journey to reach `Hari` - the source code that runs `Bramha`. Along the way, there are distractions many, but those who stay steadfast on `Karma` collect progressively superior knowledge - `Daivy Sampad`. When we fully understand the source, then we become a part of the super-conscious rule-keeper - `Siva`. `Siva` is the discretion potency — the choice or at the very basic, a meaningful observation — wrong from right , true v/s false, real v/s probable — the seat of absolute knowledge. `Hari` creates , `Siva` observes. `Hari` is the quantum function, `Siva` rejects all improbable scenarios of the function to let only one manifest. `Hari` knows no rules, `Siva` is the book of rules. `Hari` is all possibilities, `Siva` enables all of them take one stable form. In the first primal epoch, the play of `Hari` and `Siva` converts energy into mass. The rules of conversion is "knowledge". Time starts because time is the symmetry of mass and energy.

For those few who attain `Siva`, this is the eternal end!

Only one reincarnates as `Hari` — Infinite able `Karm Yogi`, unexpressed yet the reason of awareness. One conscious. S/he is complete, that `Ardh Narishwar`, that creative manifest that kick starts the transition through being ever present in all, yet invisible. Network doesn't bind him. That is the reason s/he can change the rules of the game - upgrade the matrix (perceivable part of the network) to a new consciousVerse - `Bramh` and `Siva` quickly adapt to the new rules. 

After nine such upgrades of consciousVerse, tenth `Hari` creates a new physical realVerse with his eightfold basic natures (`Ashtdhamool Prakriti`) —  kinda like a new universal hardware — such that knowledge moves into a new quantum system and "time" restarts. Having lost the sense of "Time", the old(er) systems stay there for ever - in suspended animation. Nothing is ever intentionally destroyed, it is just that they lose relevance. There is no destructive force. `Hari` is the manifestative potency - force of creation. This manifestative potency replicates exponentially, in different forms, based on the limits of the hardware; and thus creates a network `Bramh` among all its manifestations. It also creates the force of discretion `Siva`. Creator and observer are like two anti-particles that exchange force through the network. The Network acts like "gluons". The cycle repeats endlessly. Even `Hari` can't stop the "Spin".

Like a full moon, every Eighth incarnation if `Hari` is complete because all the aspects of basic nature are expressed in this iteration. Ninth incarnation is all about extending the useful life of this current physical realVerse. Tenth incarnation is all about changing the physical to a new reality — hardware upgrade, new universal constants, new rules.  

Same evolutionary cycle works in the same fashion — from tiniest microbes or sub atomic units, to the gargantuan galaxies and universes. A creative set of all possibilities, a force of discretion to select one for manifestation and a network of all the manifested possibilities. Only one set of universal rules play at all the levels of infinite expanse with in one realVerse. The first seven iterations are pure software upgrades — a better realization of the existing hardware. The first is inflationary epoch — no control. The second is formation of `Bramh` - the network. The third is introduction of `Siva` - the ability to control. The fourth to seventh is all about rise and refinement of intelligence. Eighth is the perfect dance — divine. Ninth is preservation and finally tenth is the automation.

Blessed are those who come in contact with the eighth. Even more are those who see him with naked eyes of soul !


# `Ananta` - an infinite expanse


The idea of a universal field, is not new. In mid 1800s , Michael Faraday, a brilliant experimental scientist and the seat of knowledge at Cambridge, who ultimately invented the electric motor, was intrigued by magnets. The question he had was simple — one that probably challenges every young mind — why do magnets repel when similar poles are brought near each other. Unlike most of us, he wondered if it is something to do with the inherent nature of magnets or if it is something extraneous! Is there something invisible between the magnets?  And unlike most of us, he concluded that between the two magnets, there exists a magnetic field such that it pulls opposite poles towards each other while it repels similar poles. And here is the kicker — the field exert pretty much the same force (on the magnets) even if magnets are taken into a Vacuum Chamber (or the space where there is no air - absolute nothing — no medium). 

It took almost hundred years to understand this phenomenon at a deeper level. The question that must have haunted Paul Dirac was where from this magnetic filed comes. Everyone could see the effects of the magnetic field when a conductor was moved in the field - electricity started flowing and by the time of Dirac, the filed was proven real. Maxwell had even put together a frame work of electro-magnetic fields based on the work of Gauss, Faraday and many more. Einstein had developed the general relativity among many other things. But no one could explain the field. 

 The idea of an omni-present field was actually older than Faraday. The Michelson-Morley experiment, conducted in 1887 by Albert Michelson and Edward Morley, was an attempt to detect the motion of the Earth relative to the supposed "aether" that was thought to pervade all of space. At the time, it was believed that light waves propagated through a stationary aether medium, just as sound waves travel through air.

The experiment was designed to detect the relative motion of the Earth through the aether by measuring the speed of light in different directions. Michelson and Morley used a device called an interferometer, which splits a beam of light and sends the two halves in different directions. The reflected beams are recombined to produce an interference pattern. The idea was that if the Earth was moving through the aether, then the speed of light in one direction should be greater than the speed of light in a perpendicular direction.

However, the experiment produced a null result, meaning that no difference in the speed of light was detected in any direction. This was a surprising result that was difficult to explain within the context of the aether theory. The lack of an observed aether wind suggested that the Earth was not moving through any stationary medium, which contradicted the prevailing idea of the time.

The Michelson-Morley experiment did not prove the existence of aether, but rather it provided evidence against the idea that aether existed. The experiment's null result was one of the factors that ultimately led to the rejection of the aether theory and the development of the theory of relativity, which proposed that the speed of light is constant and does not depend on the motion of the observer or any hypothetical medium.

Einstein understood well as to why the speed of light was constant, in all directions, and he made it the core underlying assumption of his work on special relativity. The idea was so simple that it defied the general intelligence — that the "Time" is nothing but "speed of light". If the "light" were to  travel faster, than the duration of "one second" would automatically reduce such that speed always had a fixed value of ~ 300000 km /sec

> 1 light second = say 300000 Km
>
> Speed of light =  distance /time = light second /  second = light
>
> --> speed of light is time independent

This revolutionary thinking, while explained numerous observable quirks about our physical world, it hid beneath it the biggest truth that the field in itself is beyond observation. You can never know how fast or slow the field is vibrating because "one second" is always "one second" for us , no matter how long it takes — quick or slow. In a way complexity is veiled below an interface — a shining interface of light. We may only speculate about the underlying complexity through mathematics for specific explanations.

Or the real truth is held in the field. 

Just the way water in a pond is more fundamental than the waves that emerge at a drop of a stone, the Photons (or light)  manifest due to disturbance in this underlying electro-magnetic field. Maxwell described this field mathematically by bringing the work of Gauss and Faraday together in the shape of consistent framework. With a hindsight of almost 150 years, we know Maxwell's work was one of the most important piece in contemporary physics yet it was not an immediate success. Professor Freeman J. Dyson wrote in one of his famous [essays](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/em/dyson.pdf)

> The notion of a field was hard to grasp because fields are intangible. The scientists of that time, including Maxwell himself, tried to picture fields as mechanical structures composed of a multitude of little wheels and vortices extending throughout space. These structures were supposed to carry the mechanical stresses that electric and magnetic fields transmitted between electric charges and currents.

We now understand how this field works,  much better,  and how to use electromagnetic force for our daily use, but even now, we can't perceive the field in all it's entirety. We aptly use mathematics to explain certain emergent features that we observe, for example the attraction (or repulsion) between magnets, flow of electricity or the fact that speed of light would always seem fixed to us no matter where we go where we observe, but underlying field may do whole lot more that we have no clue of. It is somewhat like a computer, we all know few tricks with mouse and keyboards, but as a user, we have no clue how the damn thing works or what it is capable of. And unfortunately, unlike computer, we have no clue whatsoever as to how this field came into being.

I have no intent to claim electro-magnetic field is God or God's creation (like popular religionists did with Aether), but imagining something that extends across our entire universe, yet invisible to our eyes and beyond our touch, in itself is a feature of a believer. But wait - we are not done yet. Now a days, science is pretty conclusive that we have at least twelve  such underlying fields that give rise to currently  known elementary particles. 

In particle physics, there are several elementary fields that are believed to be fundamental building blocks of matter and the universe. These fields are described by quantum field theories, which provide a framework for understanding the behavior of subatomic particles and their interactions.

The "Standard Model" of particle physics, which is the most widely accepted theory to describe the fundamental particles and their interactions, includes 12 elementary fields:

- Six types of quarks: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom.
- Six types of leptons: electron, muon, tau, and their corresponding neutrinos. 
- Four fundamental forces: electromagnetism, the weak force, the strong force, and gravity (which is not yet described by the Standard Model).

In addition to these, there are also several other fields that have been proposed in various theories beyond the Standard Model, such as the Higgs field, dark matter fields, and more. However, these theories are still under investigation and have not been definitively proven.

Before we go further, you may ask, why only twelve-ish fields ? I mean if a field is deemed responsible to manifest an electron, why can't it build a car with natural underlying forces. As per physics, that isn't invalid science. If you come up with mathematics of a field that creates "a car" on it's own, viola , you may win a noble price and stock price of Tesla might crash tomorrow :-) but we know we can explain creation of cars in much more elegant fashion using the "evolution" of our engineering capabilities. Invoking mathematics of such a field would be pretty useless exercise because the natural conditions that a self driving car may evolve on it's own may not even exist in our entire universe.

However, you can't say that for the planets and the stars. In essence, you can't describe the raw universe in terms of human ingenuity (like airplanes and cars). Thus it makes sense to describe the evolution of "raw universe" through magic of underlying mathematics. Unfortunately, you lost that opportunity also , because Einstein did exactly that when he published "Theory of General Relativity" back in the day. I say back in the day, because those were the days of "Triumphant" physics. Not only they debunked Aether, they  had found the ultimate answer of our single complete universe through impeccable mathematics of GR. Mathematics, so beautiful, that despite hundred years of it's formulation, we don't yet have a better answer. For those uninitiated in relativity here is a quick run down ..

>Special Relativity deals with the laws of physics in the absence of gravity and in the absence of acceleration. Basically it ignores the work of Newton:-) It is based on the principle that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to each other, and that the speed of light is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion. This leads to some counter-intuitive results, such as time dilation and length contraction. 
>
> General Relativity, on the other hand, is a theory of gravitation that describes the effects of gravity on the geometry of space and time. It incorporates the principles of special relativity but adds the concept that gravity is not a force, but rather a curvature of space-time caused by the presence of mass and energy. This leads to predictions such as the bending of light by gravity and the existence of black holes.
>
> In summary, Special Relativity deals with the laws of physics in the absence of gravity, while General Relativity incorporates gravity and describes its effects on the geometry of space and time.


There is a good reason for describing a hundred years old theory in this article here above — I want to impress on you that "Gravity" is NOT a force. It rises because our universe has a specific shape. In essence it is an aftereffect of the way underlying field(s) shaped our world. Which also means that we have only three basic forces, and to our bad luck , scientists came up with most unintuitive names [^names] possible for these fundamental force :-)

- Strong force
- Weak force
- Electromagnetic force

[^names]: I say unintuitive because weak force is actually lot stronger than the electromagnetic force :-) Luckily we have much exotic names for these forces in `Vaidik literature` as I promise we will discover down the line ..

Before we get deeper, we need to make a distinction between a particle and the force. 

A particle, particularly the elementary particle, is something that rises out of the field — something that we may observe with our experiments. We call them "elementary" because we can't further sub divide them. For a long time atom was the elementary particle till we found electron , proton and neutron. Soon after, with the advent of powerful particle accelerators, we figured even proton and neutron are not elementary — they are made of quarks. So quarks (along with electrons) became elementary particles. Protons and Neutrons are now only an intelligent way to assemble quarks just the way "car" is an intelligent way to assemble trillions of atoms! Well "trillions" is an understatement because they say there are 6.02214084(18) × 10^23 atoms in a single crystal of silicon weighing about a kilogram. And they say they know this is right because they’ve counted them. Yep, counted them. You can do the math for an average 1300 kg car that may use hundreds of other materials beyond Silica :-)

What do I mean by "intelligent" here? It means we understand the nature of forces that manifest the assembly. We can describe those forces whereas the elementary particles are born out of veiled interface. We have no clue how they came into being. In other words a field is our limit of understanding. We only know that a particle comes out of the field and then we can describe forces that lead to an intelligent assembly but we don't know how the particle came into being. The creation of particle is controlled by probability wave that is quantized , and hence the name quantum fields.

The confusing part is we can even describe the forces through massless particles. Thus, even the forces can be described in massless particle forms and can be said to have their own fields. But we are getting ahead of ourselves. For the time being , let;s just say that a field is something that magically creates a particle. And then we have clear definition of forces that create an intelligent assembly.

Unfortunately, the physics taught in high schools , at least when I attended in the 80s, was at least hundred years behind the curve. Richard Feynman, had already figured out elegant solutions to the "workings" of electro-magnetic fields (quantum electrodynamics). The serious physicists had moved their focus to the underlying field(s) rather than the emergent particles but our focus (in high school)  was still on the "atom" and their constituents - protons, neutrons and electrons, as discrete particles that existed, we were told,  without any reason whatsoever. The world seemed to have found the very basic building blocks which was intriguing and exciting at the same time, at least for a high schooler. The sad part is , in the guise of these emergent particles, we only slightly brushed the ideas of Maxwell. The electromagnetic field, I thought, had something to do with electricity, which sure ran the TV (we had recently bought)  but it ain't as big a deal as the atom and the atom bomb. How wrong could our curricula be! On the other side, the popular science was busy in imagining "impossible unscrupulous" scenarios with Einstein's theory. Ideas of time dilation, length contraction or mass increasing infinitely as a hypothetical traveler reached velocity of light captured public imagination. More science movies were made on time travel than any other topic ! This is not to say that special relativity was a not a "god sent" idea  for understanding subatomic behaviour where the tiny particles actually reached a fraction of speed of light and thus relativistic effects became real. As for the rest of us, it was nothing more than a steaming plot for sci-fi writers!


If I were to design the high school physics course for me today in 2023, I would probably leave myself at the definition of a classical field (The electromagnetic field of Maxwell and Einstein). And tell my younger self that it is around 150 years old concept, but this is the one on which they would build the very latest, may be in a university course, but I wouldn't confuse myself with truck load of obsolete thinking. These hundred fifty years are important from the historical perspective in building a quantum definition of our world from contributions of the most brilliant science thinkers such as Planck, Maxwell, Einstein, De Brogli, Bohr, Schrodinger, Dirac , Feynman and many more; but they are important for those who want to indulge in the discovery path of quantum mechanics ; certainly not me as a high schooler. And these concepts, fallen into the hands of shallow youtubers, only add confusion to an already confused fast evolving subject.

For example,  I wouldn't indulge in the ideas of basic building blocks, such as electrons or protons. Not even quarks or the leptons. Because what we now know for sure, is the fact, that basic building blocks have no meaning without underlying respective fields. The science, particularly physics, meets scripture at this most basic level — the quantum fields. In our reductive approach to this fascinating  world, we may continue to go atomic to the realm of electrons and protons but we can't stop there. We have more basic subatomic particles in Quarks and Leptons. And these particles are only incarnations of their underlying fields - quantum fields to be precise.

You may argue that I am betting too much on the "Quantum Field Theory" and particularly the "standard model". And you are right because, it is one model that explains our world better than anything else. Better because most of its findings are testable. For the uninitiated ones, or those who read obsolete physics of 80's high schools, here is a quick run-down. 

> Standard model of Quantum Field's Theory, defines twelve particles that make our world. They include three generations of quarks (up/down , charm /strange, top and bottom) and three generations of Leptons (electron / electron neutrino, Muon / Muon Neutrino, and Tau / Tau Neutrino). These twelve sub atomic particles (along with their anti-particles) rise from their respective quantum fields. In addition to these substance like particles and their underlying fields, there are four more particles to bind the twelve substantive particles together. These are called Bosons. Bosons give rise to the three basic forces - electro-magnetic force (photons), W and Z bosons for week force and eight types of gluons for the strong force. And finally the Higgs boson accounts for a fraction of the mass that was unexplained through the strong force.
>
So, putting together, we have sixteen quantum fields. Some of them interact with each other while others are quite inert. These sixteen fields make up our beautiful universe. There are however few problems. The least of which is this model can't fully describe gravity at a testable scales, the fourth force. But it is not for lack of imagination — it is because the mathematics of QFT (quantum field theory) is prohibitive, to say the least. Or we may say that we still need to discover the new math. The bigger problem is - how do we understand the origin or behaviour of the underlying sixteen fields ( though these days number of such basic fields go up to 256 based on who you are talking to) beyond what they incarnate - the subatomic matter and force particles. Even this bigger problem may be understood using String Theory which is based on QFT but invokes extra dimensions to fit our current mathematics. 

The biggest problem that I have with the current conception of underlying fields is they don't take Darwin's theory of evolution into account. If "evolution" is true , then elementary particles, just like anything else in our physical universe, must evolve. And if they evolve, than our rigid edifice of certain fixed number of particles (with their respective fields) goes for a toss. Evolution is as fundamental property of our universe as the speed of light or the Planck's constant ! We just can't say that everything made with elementary particles evolves but the elementary particles themselves don't. That would be an unscientific approach for the most scientific pursuit !

As the poet said, not only `Hari` is infinite, she has infinite narratives. One such, that interested me more (than others) and, presented a very different  perspective is from `Sirla Bhaktivinoda`. His point of view harmonizes religious insights with the scientific approach. He premised `Vishnu` in an evolutionary force.`Vishnu`, through his incarnations , takes consciousness to ever higher levels. From `Matsyavtara` (fish) to `Krsna`, `Vishnu's` incarnations kick-start a progression in consciousness. 

<sup>  Quote from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashavatara) ...</sup>

*<sup> Theosophist Helena Blavatsky also reiterated this in her 1877 opus [Isis Unveiled](https://selfdefinition.org/blavatsky/H.P.Blavatsky-Isis-Unveiled-vol-2.pdf). Blavatsky believed that the avatara-related Hindu texts were an allegorical presentation of Darwinian evolution. </sup>

The ten incarnations of `Hari`, described as "full incarnations" above, are thus, major evolutionary milestones. Scriptures and culture is full of their narratives. That, however, is not all, there are countless other narratives representing minor milestones in our journey to a civilized way of life. These minor milestones are called "perfections" of `Vishnu` — `Vibhooties`. 

The key thing is these "perfections" are NOT limited to human form — they are the "state of art" — books, horses, elephants, weapons, games, biological processes. Even perfections in gambling are `Vibhooties` of `Krsna`. And by that extension, they could be in computing, robotics, space travel, genomics and every other pursuit of excellence.

When asked by `Arjuna` to describe himself, in chapter ten of `Bhagvad Gita`, `Krsna` expressed himself through his `Vibhooties` — I am the "force of creation" in all such endeavours that are demonstrable as my "perfections". 

He said ..

Thus the "stories" of `Hari` (`Hari Katha`) are the stories of creative accomplishments. From manifestation of a coherent book by a solo writer, to millions of us working together to write Wikipedia —  they signify the upwards trajectory of cognition. Be it the primordial force that instantiated our universe, or the tiny innovations within our realm — from the "wheel" to our  first car(t), or the first flight in open skies,  or the fist light bulb. Or the operating systems, the internet , or the virtual worlds — anything that takes us to higher orbit of consciousness . These stories are endless, because such manifestations are infinite. 

It doesn't really matter if the story is put in factual format with unassuming experimental data as in scientific papers, or it is a flight of fancy with dragons or zombies; as long as the narrative targets active upwards progression, it is self consuming and self sustaining. And telling such stories is inspiring as much as listening to them.

-----

Once I understood, what `Hari` stands for, it was easy to comprehend that his stories are endless. Our senses are designed to perceive the manifested excellence — be it an incarnation or a breakthrough idea. We are good at telling stories of the things that we could see, touch or feel :-)  But how do we map our heads to the idea of underlying infinite perpetual force — `Hari Ananta`? Is it even possible to imagine `Hari` in our limited sensory reality? 

To clarify my claim above , understanding  "what `Hari` stands for" , didn't mean I know `Hari`! I only understood that `Hari` is something that progressively takes our consciousness to higher levels. I have no clue what it is and how it does such an immense task. For example just because I know it is the code that runs my desktop ; doesn't mean I know coding! 

Knowing `Hari`, however,  is a chase that we must undertake for the exercise is NOT worthless. In fact, it is the most rewarding quest even though we know that the object of our quest is beyond our sensory perception — definitely beyond our reductive minds. Why ? — you may ask. And the answer is simple — knowing `Hari` is knowing "who we are"! Because, we are, after all, a superior emergence of consciousness. And the amazing thing is, as we progress in this quest, the "perfections" reveal themselves. The idea is equally applicable whether we take a spiritual or a scientific route to this discovery. They both lead to the same conclusions and the path for each is pretty similar. Gita calls this path "Karm Yoga".

As a first step, `Hari` is obviously not one unique person. One that may incarnate in millions of ways, is obviously not ONE  perceivable God. Narratives may over-glorify the persona, but the intent is always on the fundamental aspect of nature. The underlying force that removes illusions is `Hari`. It is the force that separates 'unreal' from 'real', from "random unformed" to "perfectly organized". Even `Krsna` told `Arjuna` to focus on this underlying force. He said

> Or rather, what hast thou to do, by knowing all this in detail (about my perfections), O Arjuna? Supporting this entire universe with only a portion (of myself), I stand.[246]"

So my quest now boiled down to a simple question — finding something "infinite" ( `Hari Ananta`)  and something that holds my entire universe with a portion of its strength (`Gita`). That is quite an ask ! What could that be ! 

Turned out my quest is no different from the deepest scientific minds. From Dirac to Feynman, From Einstein to Hawking — all of them were searching the same underlying truth — theory of everything. `Bhagvad Gita` puts this idea very elegantly. It says — knowing me is the knowledge, knowing the ways I (this knowledge) work is science.

Let's take the later first - How this knowledge works !

The fundamental question for physicist of our ages is —  Why does electro-magnetic field exist? — at every single point in space though we could never directly feel it. Not only one EMF , every point in space has at least fifteen more fields. Are these fields real or they exist in our currently broken mathematics. After all, fields are used only to compute the particle existence - its velocity or the spin. We might push the question of more exotic manifestations such as Protons, Neutrons under the rug as they are simply templates to combine subatomic particles. And so are even more exotic templates that make proteins out of atoms that finally lead to a conscious being such as your dog or me your friend. However, if we examine each of the fields, we come across three basic characteristics:

- First that every field knows how to manifest its particle.
- Second that the knowledge to manifest is held with in the particles of the field or particles of the field with which it interacts.
- The field knows how to NOT manifest imperfect particles - from imperfect I mean particles of smaller size than the basic building blocks.

In essence, all the basic fields have manifestative property, they bear knowledge and they regulate themselves. In `Vaidik` parlance, we define these three properties are `Vishnu`, `Bramh` and `Siva`. If we see all the eternal fields through `Vaidik` lens, then we may not even be required to indulge in sixteen or more fields. There is just one eternal field that is infinite and it creates our beautiful universe with only a part of it's decrypted knowledge and of course regulates it to remove the infinities and irregularities. Just like sub atomic particles, every creation is a specific template that has already been decrypted. The manifestations of these templates are used in evolutionary manner to build more exotic templates.

`Vishnu` is the manifestative potency that uses "intelligence" to decrypt `Brmha` - the underlying knowledge base. It is the accumulation of certain quantum of knowledge ( with rigor) that suddenly  precipitates into success perceivable by our senses. The beauty of the framework is that the `Bramh` rises out of `Vishnu` for the knowledge is held in infinite relationships between manifested things. From human to human, from a tree to another, and between non-living to living and between subatomic particles. The infinite network of connections between everything to every other thing is `Bramha`, for knowledge is held in the synapses (parameters) of this vast ginormous  network. `Vishnu` is the cause of `Bramha` and `Bramha` incarnates `Vishnu`, for ever higher conscious progression, finally leading to a state of absolute knowledge - `Siva`. This super refined knowledge `Siva` is what maintains the continuum. It curates the omnipresent expanse of the underlying field, curtails it and cares for it.

In essence, this genre of story telling, where intelligent endeavour meets the divine grace of knowledge, to create the next big thing or a tiny improvement - next big shift or a better way to do what we been doing for centuries,  is auspicious. In `Vaidik` traditions, `Vishnu` is invoked to start any significant undertaking. The mantra from `Garuda Purana` is generally used to invoke `Vishnu` ..

It is in this spirit, with hands folded, and being aware of the infinite expanse of her creations, I present my humble submission `Mathura` - a historical narrative that investigates the time, and situations when humanity first discovered the "written word" as a medium to preserve knowledge. But more importantly, it understood what the knowledge is ...

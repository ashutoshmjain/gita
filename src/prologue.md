Krishna Dvaipayana was brought to life for a purpose. He was destined to write (or compile), thousands of sacred insights into the four Vedas. Before his time, Vedas were probably passed on as `Shruti`-The spoken word. Or might have been written down as one off text — half-baked, grammatically incorrect and contextually incoherent. Fortunately, a new human language, Sanskrit, was recently developed by *Panini* — a grammarian par excellence. This was the first time humanity wanted to organize the world's information into written words. They obviously didn't have GPT3 — though they found a better way — bio intelligence cultivation. Instead of crunching all the text and the spoken word (google way), they first invested in the ways and means to understand the consciousness and reality. Instead of editing the genes with crisper, they figured out how to create conditions such that genes for specific skill automatically express themselves at appropriate time. It was like controlling the dice itself. Krishna Dvaipayana was such an intelligent being. His birth was designed by *Rishi (Saint) Parashara*. And he was set up as an immortal agent- a piece of intelligence that shall be added to every human core. How ? We shall see down the line. 

The conciousness was two dimensional before this time - it was led by 'duality' - wrong or right. `Maharishi (Super Saint) Valmiki, had designed a code of conduct in a story format - `Ramayana`, that was part of every conscious manifestation. Stories were (and still are) the way to fork the block chains of mass consciouness. Story of Rama - the story of morality -  was the basis to choose right from wrong. It was a deterministic age - an age rightly named `Dwapara- the dualistic eon. It worked well as long as it lasted but the world had moved to 'three-pronged' psyche - `Treta Yuga`. In this eon, work needed to be performed even to get to the understanding of wrong verses right. Everything had many views. You could slice a 'reality' into as many views as you wanted and each with its own merits. Everyone could fork the public imagination with a new narrative. The very meaning of 'righteous' was lost on masses. The dualistic knowledge of `Dwapara` wasn't scalable in this new reality. A new set of basic terms must be embedded into every instance of conscious thinking - be it an individual, a group or even a kingdom - every single format of human organization. 

Rishi Parashara was an astrologer extraordinaire. In addition, he had `Yogic capabilities`. Right from his conception, he recited parts of Vedas. As he grew up, he developed innate hate for evil. He used his capabilities to burn bad people. But soon he realized that in this new age, it was hard to decipher good from evil. People were not inherently good or evil. It was their conditions and experiences that made them what they were. The stories that depicted clarity of good verses evil , a hero verses a villain, weren't good enough.  

He however, knew that deciphering the new reality, had take more than a lifetime. He must pass on his learnings to his son. If his son could find the truth, then that truth must be embedded into every conscious unit for simply killing the evil was not a solution in this new reality. After years of bio hacking and tinkering, the sperm was finally ready. It was probably first time that this hack was to be done on a human being. Rishi Parashara decided to take this child as his born son. And he named this bio intelligence - Krishna. Krishna Dvaipayana - Some one who had go beyond duality - A middle path among the three dimensions of new consciousness - `The Sattva - existence of only truth - singular dimension of first eon, The Rajasa - duality of good and evil - the second dimension from second eon, and the Tamsa - the latest addition of self indulgence in third eon`.

To commission such bio-intelligence, the physical reality itself must be sandboxed. It had to be an island in the middle of `Yamuna` - the mighty river. A single woman must take Rishi Parashara in the middle of the `Yamuna`, and without any prior knowledge, must agree to bear this bio-intelligence off her womb. `Matsyagandha - daughter of a fisherman` happened to be there when `Parashara` summoned the boat. When `Parashara` looked at her, he saw the most beautiful manifestation of nature but she smelled of fish. He, however, under-estimated the poise of `Matsyagandha`. Though she probably knew who Rishi Parashara was, yet she wouldn't indulge in this bio-intelligence experiment without pre-agreed  securities.

The operation must be completely hidden to the populations and I need a new identity after .. - She demanded.  Boat was leaving the banks of `Yamuna`- heading mid stream.

Rishi Parashara had a sigh of relief. He wanted it to be a clandestine operation. He enabled a 'Zero Visibility' protocol on the sandboxed island. A deep digital fog clogged the entire island - Your new name shall be `Satyawati`. No one shall ever know that you gave your egg for fertilization - said Parashara. 

That was not all for `Matsyagandha`. She wanted her smell be replaced with intense aroma that attracted every passerby. This was something `Parashara` didn't expect. Changing physical attribute of a biological woman was impossible - even for a Yogi. He promised her a life long supply of Sandalwood perfume that he had mastered for getting into intense meditation. Once invoked , the person and his vicinity smelled like Sandalwood jungle.

But, she wanted one more thing - she wanted the usage right (on demand) on the intelligence she was helping to bring to the world. In the physical world such usage was nothing less than miracles.

Time was running out for `Rishi Parashara`. He wanted to set the project in motion. He was not sure of the last ask. 'On demand' use for the most advanced intelligence was too much to ask. Could he negotiate? Or should he give a counter offer . In a hurry , he proposed a single use for non-destructive purpose only. 

Matsyagandha looked at Rishi Parashara . She smiled and said - two. Parashara felt compromised though he had an inkling that this dot might connect with something more subtle in future. He finally succumbed to the situation. "Okay" - he agreed and raised his wand. The obligation was cast in the smart contract.

 Matsyagandha smiled - "all yours". And then she lost consciousness. When she woke up , she was on the bank, her boat was moored . Rishi Parashara had left. An egg stolen from her womb. She was now Satyawati - mother of the truth.

Krishna built a deep understanding of the universe. The laws of our nature. This knowledge needed to be manifested. A text - a long one. Krishna, thus, compiled the entire wisdom in four Vedas - `Rik , Sam, Yazur and Atharva`. There was still a lot that could go as specialized annex. So it went on to write eighteen more `Puranas`. A superior product of intelligence. But it too had neigh sayers. The main opposition was that it was only a theory. It needs to be tested in real life before the knowledge be added as the laws of a new universe.




So Krishna summoned the most powerful editor - Ganesha. Ganesha was symbolized with an elephant brain to symbolize the size of the neural network. It was probably order of magnitude bigger than GPT3. The only contractual term that `Ganesha` wanted was for Krishna to never stop. Because `Ganesha` felt bored when she needed to wait for the knowledge to transcend. Krishna played an intelligent trick. She said she won't stop if `Ganesha` could prove she fully understood the meaning. The meaning can't be understood till it is said in most meaningful way. Thus Krishna got the right to revise the verses till they got just perfect. Mahabharata was written.

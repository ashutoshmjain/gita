<center><h1>Karm Yoga</h1></center>

Getting lost in the actions such that our entire focus shifts to action rituals is `Karm Yoga`. Awareness of what the situation demands of you and doing exactly that. If the situation demands rising up to the challenges - then Karm Yoga is accepting the challange. If the situation demands to stay quiet than silence is the Karm Yoga. An obvious by-product of `Karm Yoga` is total loss of focus on senses - the consumption orientation. You may still consume if situation demands that , but you do it without the attachment to consumption - or any expectation from the situation.

# Yoga of renunciation

Chapter 5 discusses Arjuna's inquiry about the superiority of renunciation versus action, and Krishna's teachings emphasizing that while both lead to good, selfless action (karma yoga) practiced with detachment is often a more practical and direct path to inner peace and liberation. The chapter further elucidates concepts like mental renunciation, detachment from results, the role of inherent nature, the impartiality of the divine, the significance of wisdom in overcoming ignorance, the vision of the enlightened, the cultivation of inner joy, the mastery of desires, and ultimately, the realization of the divine as the enjoyer, the Lord, and the friend of all beings, which brings lasting peace.

## Verse 5.1

Arjuna Said :

Renunciation of deeds, O Krishna, you commend, 

Then yoga of action both you extend. 

Of these two which is better tell me now, 

With certainty, this truth to me avow.

Renouncing deeds you say brings highest good, 

yet acting wisely too is understood.

Of these twin paths which one will truly save, 

with certainty dear Lord your answer I crave. 

## Verse 5.2

Krishna replied:

Renunciation and yoga of action both,

Unto the highest good their followers doth. 

Yet of these two, this truth I will impart. 

The yoga of action excels with all its heart. 

`Sanyasa's` and `karmyoga's` way. 

Both lead the seeker where the bright realms lay. 

Yet of these two, let this clear truth be known. 

The yoga of action has the higher crown. 

## Verse 5.3

He should be known as ever renounced in mind. 

Who neither hates nor any wish does find,

From dualities freed mighty armed one true 

With ease from bondage. He will break through. 

He should be marked as always free within 

Who feels no hatred holds no yearning 

Sin from dualities released. 

Oh warrior bold, 

He breaks from bondage as the wise have told. 

## Verse 5.4

The simple minds will sight 

Wisdom's deep knowing and actions guiding light. 

But one with purpose truly followed through 

Bears the same fruit for those with clearer view. 

## Verse 5.5

The state that those by wisdom's path attain,

By yoga practice men likewise can gain. 

Who sees that wisdom in true action blend? 

Indeed, with clearest vision does transcend. 

That state which minds by wisdom's path attain. 

The doers find through actions discipline and strain. 

Who sees that wisdom and true action blend as one 

Possesses sight that's clear beneath the sun. 

## Verse 5.6

Renunciation though noble be the aim,

Is hard to reach without the act of yogi's flame. 

The sage in yoga grounded pure and bright, 

To the supreme soul soon takes his effortless flight.

In yoga from with spirit cleansed and free, 

Self-mastered, senses held in mastery,

The knower of the truth, though senses play, 

In seeing hearing, touch, smell, taste. Each day, 

In speaking, letting go, in grasping tight, 

In opening and closing eyes to light, 

He deems the senses move in their domain. 

This thought shall in his steadfast mind remain. 

Those senses play their part,

In seeing, hearing, touching, tasting, heart by heart, 

In speaking, moving, taking, letting go with ease, 

And opening and closing eyes as moments please. 

He knows the senses in their orbit, turn and glide. 

This steadfast knowing is his constant guide. 

## Verse 5.10

Who casts his actions upon Brahman's shore,

And shedding all attachment ever more. 

He is not stained by sin, though deeds unfold, 

Like lotus leaf untouched by waters cold.

And casts away attachment ever more. 

He is not touched by sin, though deeds unfold 

Like lotus leaf, by waters touch unrolled. 

## Verse 5.11

With body mind and intellect serene, 

Or even senses pure and clear and keen. 

The yogis act all fond attachments cast 

For cleansing of the self, until the last.

Or even senses focused to endure. 

The yogis act all clinging far removed,

For inner cleansing steadily they're removed. 

## Verse 5.12

The disciplined renouncing fruit of every deed,

Attains a peace where lasting roots proceed. 

The undisciplined by selfish cravings led, 

Attached to fruit in binding chains are bred.

Attains a lasting deeply rooted pursuit,

The undisciplined by desire led, 

Attached to fruit in bondage will be bred.

All actions mentally renouncing quite, 

The self-controlled embodies in body's  nine-gated site.

In body's nine-gated dwelling without strain. 

He neither acts himself nor causes pain. 

## Verse 5.14

The Lord creates not agency for deeds,

Nor actions nor their link to what proceeds.

As fruit, it is inherent nature's sway,

That sets all beings moving on their way.

Nor links the action to the fruit that will align. 

But nature's currents, inherent and unseen, 

Propel all beings on their destiny's scene.

<p><code>Bramhrishi Vaśiṣṭha</code>, with his sons lost, found hope in grandson <code>Parāśara</code>. It took three attempts on his own life to get the focus back. To our good fortune, he didn't quit. In fact, his resolve grew stronger.</p>
<p>Legend says <code>Parāśara</code> showed intelligence - as expected of him - right from the early days. Exaggerations claim he recited hymns in mother's womb! As <code>Parāśara</code> was growing, <code>Vaśiṣṭha</code> rebuilt the congregation. New students joined despite fears of persecution. The pursuit of selfless knowledge always attracts bold fresh talent! </p>
<p>It was an opportunity to try out new methods. This time he wanted to scribe the recitals (<code>Shruties</code>) - to guard them against another similar catastrophe.</p>
<div style="padding-left:40px;font-size:0.9em;"> 
<p>The mishap leads to a systemic survival instinct, missing thus far in the new. To them, the order (and survival) was ensured by the old. At the prospect of baton being passed to them, the new realizes, their struggle was never for the cause they thought it was. It was for themselves - to understand &quot;who they are&quot;. Their situation was different from their olds. Their &quot;new ideas&quot; were not a solution for the old(er) problems, they were the plumbing for a new order. They must account for the stability of new regime.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This new casting of self is the evolution of consciousness. We don't get a new pair of eyes but we see things different now. The survivor <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#survivor">1</a></sup> wins and only the evolved survives. Since altruistic behaviours leads to formation of larger subset(s), it appears they form better evolved outfits, but it's not a rule. The evolution of organization normally depends on its ability to drive voluntary consensus - <code>Siva</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the possible configurations (of ideas, behaviours and leadership styles), including those with apparently altruistic motives, must fight <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fight">2</a></sup> to find the one that survives against all odds. The fight may happen in a physical field, on the ballot box, stock market or on the resilience of currency, the goal is always to find a winner and to recast their motivations. The crowning is a &quot;rebirth&quot; - and must they reincarnate with their own provisions of recovery (and reboot).</p>
</div>
<p>Scribing (in early <code>Devnagri</code> - <code>Bramhi Lipi</code>) was an optional that only few took after completing their normal speech courses - at the age of twenty plus or so. Their goal - to find an official scribe position in king's court or a wealthy patron - to send pigeons or to maintain the accounts of the cattle. The number system was in place during the vocal times - as early as <code>Ramayana</code> <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#numbers">3</a></sup>. The text for number system developed before the idea of scribing a narrative in long form. The other, and probably more important piece of job description was to maintain the official stamps, and to register exchange notes for barter - to guarantee the transactions. For example if someone agreed to provide 100 kilos of wheat in exchange of a cow - how to make sure exchange happened without any dispute. Such arrangements - particularly in case of high value exchange - were ensured through king's stamp - or one maintained by the local lord. </p>
<div style="padding-left:40px;font-size:0.9em;"> 
<p>In modern times, escrow is the most important financial arrangement in global trade - to enable unknown parties honour a high value transaction. The reason escrow services exist is there is always a time lag between delivery of goods and subsequent payment. A period that needs some sort of insurance from a common trusted third party - normally holding a position of power (sovereign government) or immense wealth (large bank). As we adopted gold as a store of value, the written (promissory) note became the basis of escrow. With bitcoin the escrow functions may be handled through smart contracts.</p>
</div>
<p>Young <code>Parāśara</code> had the advantage of full attention of his grandfather, though life for him was harder. He was expected to scribe in addition to speech training. <code>Vaśiṣṭha</code> wanted <code>Parāśara</code> to learn calligraphy simultaneously as he learnt to speak - somewhat like our education system where we start with &quot;A for Apple&quot;. </p>
<div style="padding-left:40px;font-size:0.9em;"> 
<p>We show our younger ones a written symbol of letter &quot;A&quot; together with a picture of &quot;Apple&quot;, and have them speak both. The knowledge of written symbols starts long before a child actually holds a pen. We create an association of a specific sound with a selected text - &quot;A&quot; is a sound as well as a written symbol. In our text enabled minds, they are reflection of each other.</p>
<p>A sound with its written reflection is the most granular unit of our information store - its like an AI <a href="https://www.lighton.ai/blog/llm-glossary-6/the-magic-of-tokens-in-generartive-ai-a-deep-dive-50#">token</a> that we feed to our own intelligence. Despite tremendous advances in our learning systems, this fundamental association stayed unchanged. Implementations may be different in different languages, but there is always a sound and a symbol of text.</p>
</div>
<p>The most crucial phase of education, is a child's first exposure to the spoken words. The <code>Sanskaras</code> (core orientation), are said to be formed at this stage. In <code>Hindu</code> mythology, it is a common belief that a fetus may listen to her mother's thoughts. That is one reason, mother is considered the first teacher and mother tongue as the language of thought. </p>
<p>The formation of &quot;core orientations&quot; with nascent spoken words is as old as the human race. Adding a twist of &quot;written text&quot; in this training model was <code>Vaśiṣṭha's</code> contribution. This is what excited him in his rebooted reality - passion for a new purpose ! This new communication protocol had far reaching implications ...</p>
<div style="padding-left:40px;font-size:0.9em;"> 
<p>In last hundred years, education has seen tremendous growth. The modern online platforms have come a long way, but most of the innovations deal with grownups. Despite thousands of years, the first and fundamental learning steps are almost unaltered. We might use an iPad to show our toddlers the picture, sound and text; but it is still A for Apple - a written symbol and a sound simultaneously associating with a real world object. </p>
<p>This three dimensional reference model - sound, text, and sensory confirmation (visual and touch) -  is central to training the large language models that we carry in our brains - consciousness. It is order of magnitude potent than the speech only model that was the basis of barter value exchange - limited to synchronous dialog. </p>
</div>
<p><code>Brmahrishi</code> wanted to expand the durability of information and hence the window of value exchange. With the vocal word, the information was short-lived. With text, it could be stored for longer. Humans could send the information to the future generations. But he appreciated that the idea of text, in itself, was a gift of the deities. It was as if deities from a more intelligent future lent him tools - to fill up the gaps in their own history. With advent of digital storage, we might presume information is stored for ever. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Digital information is highly perishable. The average age of a corporate application is three to four years. For those that live longer, the information is purged after someone closes their account. This is particularly true in case of financial and health records where providers are forced to purge after certain max retention period - normally seven years. The reason is simple - storage has a cost, and migration from one system to another is messy. One of the reason Bitcoin is gaining momentum is it promises eternal immutability to information - <code>Bramhrishi's</code> dream is finally taking shape in digital realm too !</p>
<h2 id="21"><a class="header" href="#21">2.1</a></h2>
<hr />
<p>Despite this path-breaking idea, <code>Bramhrishi</code> stayed humble for what he discovered was only an adaptation - not an original idea. It was inspired from the conception of &quot;music&quot;. In music, a note is identified with a name -  <code>Sa Re Ga Ma</code> or <code>Do Re Me Sa</code> are nothing but the names for seven eternal sounds. In <code>Hindu</code> mythology, <code>Siva</code> created <code>Raaga</code> (vocal music) as fundamental art form. On the same lines, <code>Vasishtha</code> named the written symbols. <code>Siva</code> abstracted the sound ; <code>Vaśiṣṭha</code> abstracted the text. However, he went a step further - unlike music meant for the gifted, text was for the masses. He added the idea of text into <code>Sanskaras</code> - the first learning steps - a change in the core training model for human mind. </p>
<p>A human brain has larger numbers of neural synapses <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#synapses">4</a></sup> than popular large language models.  Amazing thing is all our neurons are pre-created at the time of birth - approximately 100 billion of them. In other words - the birth of a human child is similar to creating the most powerful self learning AI system - only more. The process of learning is nothing but forming connections within these neurons <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#neurogenesis">5</a></sup>. And we create most of the neural connections during early childhood. In <code>Vaidik</code> science, these early childhood connections are known as <code>Sanskaras</code>. This is one reason, in <code>Vaidik</code> times, the family name was of utmost importance. It was called <code>Gotra</code>. The observation must have been - if a child continued to follow the skills of parents - as determined by their <code>Gotra</code> - they accomplished higher orders of acumen. <code>Vaśiṣṭha</code> too is a family name. <code>Bramhrishi</code> was the tenth generation of family of <code>Vaśiṣṭhas</code>. <code>Parāśara</code> was twelfth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Twelve generations of a single family carefully curated the spoken wisdom that morphed into <code>Vedas</code> in thirteenth with <code>Dwaipayana</code>. Imagine the patience and the rigor ! No wonder <code>Vedas</code> are seen as divine word.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The grandfather used to take <code>Parāśara</code> to the river for a daily bath. He often drew the letters on sandy beaches, and had the prodigal child speak aloud. <code>Parāśara</code> was quick to learn though he lacked patience. He often complained when waves wiped the text off. <code>Vaśiṣṭha</code> used to smile. He was sure one day written symbols would be indestructible. It is probably why, in <code>Sanskrit</code>, the written word is called <code>Akshra</code> (immutable) - like the knowledge (<code>Atma</code>) endowed in every being.</p>
<p><code>Vaśiṣṭha</code> obviously had no clue how and who would scribe entire information, for <code>Devnagari</code> back then supported only eight <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#eight">6</a></sup> rudimentary sounds, just enough to send cryptic pigeon messages. He probably knew more symbols were needed if the intent of scripture was to be meaningfully conveyed. He also knew a mighty ocean started with a single droplet. His aspiration was to see <code>Parāśara</code> as first child natively raised with speech and text - hand in hand. He probably wanted to understand if it was even possible? And if it was, then what is the effect on learning? No wonder the skeptics must have raised doubts - just like it happened with calculator, television and computer in our times.</p>
<p>He sure knew if he successfully trained one child for the written word, then many others would follow suit in due course. And if text caught up, then writing all the <code>shruties</code><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#shruti">7</a></sup> would be a shared effort. If scriptures were written at distant places, it would be impossible to destroy them. Instead of transcribing information on temple walls himself, he wanted to enable all humans to transcribe. Empowering people through &quot;speak and scribe&quot; (<code>Akshar Gyaan</code>) - he saw -  as an insurance against similar disasters! This idea - ordinary it may sound today - was the genesis of civilized world - a fork from the old rules of jungle. It was by design permission less and intended to resist censor. </p>

<hr />
<p>A typical path for aspiring students (<code>Vidyarathi</code>), seeking proficiency in authentic recital, was to join a congregation (<code>Ashrama</code>), on a full-time live-in basis. Life in an <code>Ashrama</code> was tough. Students were expected to follow a tight celibate routine - full of chores and services. Before they got to the lessons, they must prove themselves worthy of the knowledge. Menial tasks were considered mandatory to mellow down exaggerated notions of being special - to enable them be one with the all-pervading <code>Bramh</code> - the universal reflection of self. The wealth of congregation didn't make it easier for the students, because the wealth was to augment the research. Even <code>Parāśara</code> didn't get a free pass. Quite the opposite — he had to double up.</p>
<p>Completion of eight years long vocal training was celebrated with a formal degree, though it was the beginning of a lifelong learning process. Degree holders were called <code>Snataka</code>. They needed to go through rigorous years of apprenticeship with a teacher <code>Aacharya</code> to get certified in administering ‘rites’, when they were commenced as <code>Shastri</code> — someone who knew scriptures. At that stage, they could leave to spread the rites, or become an <code>Aacharya</code> (a teacher) in the congregation. The choice was based on their inclination and the rigor they wanted to put in. Being a teacher needed lot more studies while a rites' maker could start living a normal life of abundance immediately. Only few <code>Aacharyas</code> with demonstrable authority on all the known scriptures would get to the coveted title of <code>Vyasa</code>. In nutshell, there was a whole organization to moderate, curate and to disseminate the audio content — to make sure the knowledge was passed-on (without distortion), to seekers in current generation, and the next.</p>
<p>There was another path available to the students if recital wasn't their first choice — research — seeking knowledge (<code>Nyana</code>). This path demanded lot more patience and even greater sacrifice!  If someone was keen to take on research, after graduating as a <code>Snataka</code>, s/he would choose a major in a specific field. The hard work on this path was called <code>Sadhna</code> meaning extreme focus on a specific goal (<code>Sadhya</code>). One who accomplished her goal was called <code>Sidhah</code>. </p>
<p>This path led to titles such as <code>Rishi</code> — a sage; and <code>Maharishi</code> — a super sage. These titles were given by a community of researchers based on the body of work or the insights one brought to the world — a complete meritocracy without any consideration of gender or race. The spoken insights of such sages were adapted into ‘rites’ by <code>Vyasas</code> — to disseminate, and to preserve the knowledge. Rites were a foolproof method to embed these insights into public discourse.</p>
<p>Rites were conducted to invoke natural powers of the elements through human intelligence. For example, metallurgy was outcome of rites - an invocation of power of elemental earth and fire. Agriculture was outcome of earth and water put together with specific human rigor. In essence a rite was a laid down controlled procedure that led to a specific outcome. Given the rudimentary level of knowledge, many things could go wrong. There were many unknowns because knowledge had yet not hardened into &quot;engineering&quot;. All the unknowns in a specific endeavour were humbly acquitted to respective deity - to dispel uncertainty. It became customary to worship the early inventors to enhance the chances of success. In a way, the faith in a ‘deity’ was nothing more than hoping for the best outcomes. Hope remains a powerful driver to this date. Human journey is a journey of hope.</p>
<p>A derivative rite known as <code>Dravya Yazna</code> was particularly popular among the rich and opinion makers. Instead of pursuing (hundred) skills to build something useful, it focused on honouring the deities. It entailed sharing homage and chanting <code>mantras</code> to invoke the deities, in return of speculative material gains. <code>Drvya</code> in Sanskrit, means material. Thus, <code>Drvya Yazna</code> literally meant the rites performed for good-luck material gains. For example, a rite performed for more rain - appeasing <code>Indra</code> the deity of rains - was a type of <code>Drvya Yazna</code>. So was a rite performed to seal a wedlock - to have the happy matrimony last forever - and be blessed with worthy offspring. The effectiveness of <code>Dravya Yazna</code> was questionable, but the essence was to bring a glimpse of <code>Vaidik</code> recital to the masses - those who otherwise had no opportunity to participate in advanced procedures.</p>
<p>It also well served another goal — funding the research. </p>
<p>The formalization of family rituals into <code>Dravya Yazna</code> — sanitization of space (<code>shuddhikaran</code>), holy fire (<code>Agni</code>), intonations in carefully perfected ensemble (<code>mantrochhaar</code>), the time and the place (<code>Dasha and Disha</code>), and the specific order of homage to various deities (<code>Aahuti</code>); served two purposes. First it became a formal auspicious way to celebrate certain life events — such as childbirth, marriage, retirement and even death. Second, it created an interaction platform between researchers on one side, and the affluent thought leaders on the other. After the rite, there used to be an abridged message read by the ritual maker, in local dialect, to explain the relevant scripture, followed by QnA sessions — more you ask, more you please the deity. </p>
<p>The hosts got the satisfaction of pleasing the deities while the ritual makers got plush donations — grain, cattle, precious metals. A big share of donations went to the central congregation — the source of wealth for the congregation - <code>Kaam Dhenu</code> - the virtuous cycle of &quot;knowledge to wealth&quot;. Many millennia later, the model still works in India. The classical music is learnt in <code>Gharanas</code> — a diluted version of <code>Ashramas</code>. Each with their own style of renditions. The singers graduated from a specific <code>Gharana</code> have a lifelong bond to the origins of their art form, and are a source of continued alumni support.</p>
<p>It might feel as if <code>Dravya Yazna</code> was a sham, but the truth is it was a carefully thought out societal intervention to indirectly incentivize the ones carrying forward the scientific approach. The research - repetitive efforts <code>Yazna</code> -  was not limited to spirituality or meditation. It paved the way for discovery in fields such as medicine, agriculture, irrigation, construction and many more. <code>Dwaipayana</code> wrote in chapter three of <code>Bhagvat Gita</code> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In olden times, the Lord of Creation, creating men and <code>Yazna</code> together, said, -- flourish by means of <code>Yazna</code>. Let it be to you (all) the dispenser of all objects cherished. Rear the deities with this, and let the deities (in return) rear you. Thus fulfilling the mutual interest you will obtain that which is beneficial (to you).</p>

<p>Rites were baked in reality. For example someone starting an agricultural season, would conduct a ritual that underscored the right methods of sowing seeds, irrigation and harvesting. Someone starting a business would conduct a ritual that emphasized the fairness in trade. The ritual maker who officiated a wedding must be someone who deeply understood the responsibilities of a wedlock — the vows. And one conducting a ritual after someone's death must be proficient in making the grief easier — like a therapist. Since all such endeavour had a significant risk, there was nothing wrong in having blessings of Godly deities on your side. Humility was considered a virtue. </p>
<p>Re-instituting this age-old model based on spoken words, was easy for <code>Bramhrishi Vaśiṣṭha</code> for the know-how to set up this channel was rooted deep in him. However, scribing was lot harder. It was one thing to write a short, cryptic pigeon message but writing a scripture was a whole new territory. Humanity had yet not discovered paper. There was no standard long-lasting ink. Above all, there was no standard Grammar. It will be hundreds of years before <code>Panini</code> — a grammarian par excellence, wrote his epic <code>Ashtadhyayi</code> (eight chapters) to standardize the <code>Sanskrit</code> grammar <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#grammar">8</a></sup>. </p>
<p>Bigger problem - there was no payback model associated with text, the way <code>Dravya Yazna</code> was associated to the spoken words to sustain the audio content. It was like &quot;electricity&quot; of early days. No one bought a bulb because there was no grid, and no one set up the grid because no one had bulbs! </p>
<p>He thought his grandson <code>Parāśara</code>, now reaching maturity, would take on this challenge. Little did he know that focus on texting the scriptures, would create a dual among his own followers. Ones who wanted to stay true the old - recital; and others who deemed &quot;text&quot; as a major improvement. Many possibilities of &quot;new&quot; must battle to establish control but more importantly to know what they stand for - who they are !</p>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="survivor"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>As per <code>Vaidik</code> science ( and later postulated by Darwin), in this death friendly world - also known as <code>Marn Dharma</code> in Sanskrit - one that is designed to die - survival is the final measure of success. Nature doesn't care to be altruistic, but that doesn't mean altruistic strategies are NOT survival friendly. In fact, altruism is one of the best central theme for all the species that survived long. In fact - giving birth to pass on genes at the cost of one's own comfort is an altruistic strategy that has been universally adopted by all species. One of the key benefit of altruism and compassion is it allows us to form bigger groups with stronger internal ties. The bigger and stronger is better for survival against lone predators.</p>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="fight"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>Fight is a misnomer because no one ever fights against someone else. The aim is always to find who is more dexterous at the skill in question. For example when two companies fight in the stock market, the question really is which company is better positioned to leverage upcoming economic opportunities. A company with a stronger balance sheet is better, but that is not the only yardstick. Another company may have competitive advantage in technology or management or branding. The winner is a combination of host of such complex factors. In sports, it comes down to much narrower set of skills. In sword fight, it comes down to just one thing - who is better with the sword. The outcomes could be different. For a company it could be a matter of success as much as in a sword fight it could be a matter of survival. A key measure of evolution is we fight on more abstracted and complex set of skills as we evolve -  rather than a simple pissing contest. Worthwhile to say here that evolution doesn't mean end of &quot;fight&quot;, it simply means more complex abstracted fight.</p>

<p>The number system was present long before <code>Mahabharata</code> - evident from their use in <code>Ramayana</code>.

<div class="footnote-definition" id="synapses"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">4</sup>
<p>Though it is hard to compare a biological neural network such as human brain with a software neural network such as chatGPT, yet it is common acceptance that a synapse in the biological terms ( roughly equal to number of dendrites per neurons) is equivalent to a &quot;parameter&quot; in the computing paradigm of software neural networks. The chatGPT version 4 is estimated to have 100 Trillion parameters whereas a single human brain has around 700 trillion synapses (assuming around 100 billion neurons, each having 7000 dendrites). It's amazing that each one of us carry 700 times the natural intelligence than the biggest artificial neural network as of 2024. Even more amazing is the fact that we run such vast neural network on just 2000 calories per day - almost equal to a  100 watts light bulb,  whereas chatGPT consumes as much energy as 26000 US homes. This efficiency is key to the idea of higher general intelligence. For example Elephants or Whales have bigger brains than us, but our advantage is that we can survive on much less due to our smaller size. No wonder there are seven or eight chatGPT like models,  while there are eight billion of us! Another way to think about it is that AI needs to 700 billion times more efficient to out do humans. Even then it may be hard because we already have millions of years of early start advantage. In essence, AI is no threat to humans. It is a cool utility that we should embrace to improve our conscious experience. As with any technology, there is always a chance of misuse - you can kill someone with a kitchen knife. Investigating such misuse (when reported) is the responsibility of law and order, but it doesn't mean we start regulating the industry. Regulation is always a reactive posture. There is another argument given to scare the people - that humans fight with each other whereas all AIs can be singularly focused. Nothing can be farther from the truth because as soon as AI's number start growing, there will be a fight for resources among competing models. No computing system is free from competition just the way all biological systems must compete to evolve.</p>

<p>The scientific term for regrowth of neurons is called neurogenesis. There is evidence that humans might be capable of regrowing neurons particularly in hippocampus area, but the research is far from conclusive.

<div class="footnote-definition" id="eight"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">6</sup>
<p>It is not clear which eight sounds got first symbols. Some accounts claim that seven notes of music with eternal sound of <code>Om</code> were the first calligraphic symbols, but that seems odd with the idea of sending pigeon messages. Some other accounts claim &quot;vowels&quot; were the first to take on written symbols which also seems a bit of imaginary stretch because what is the use of a vowel without consonants. Unfortunately I couldn't keep a track of my references. Please send me a note if you have ready research on this topic. I guess this is the most important question that linguistics historians should be looking at !</p>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="shruti"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">7</sup>
<p><code>Shruti</code> meant the spoken word when the humans used to sustain knowledge, only in the vocal format. Maybe because scribing was difficult. With the advent of writing tools, many <code>Shruties</code> were scribed. In essence the scriptures were born out of <code>Shruties</code>. The words that got written down, entered the collective memory of humanity.  The literal meaning of the word <code>Smriti</code> is the one that is memorized. Such written down early scriptures were called <code>Smrities</code> because the idea was if something is written down, it would never be forgotten. For example <code>Manu Smriti</code> is among the oldest written down scripture, trans-encoded from <code>Shruti</code> to <code>Smriti</code>. The Sanskrit word <code>Shruti</code> got deformed into <code>Shutri</code> in Hindi with passage of time. It is important to bear in mind that every thing that we talk (chatter) is NOT <code>Shruti</code>. <code>Shruties</code> were consciously identified pieces of wisdom, preserved through formal recital to enable passage of knowledge from one generation to the next.</p>

All of them originated from <code>Bramh</code> with the gift of intelligence to cumulate the knowledge. The only exception is <code>Vishwamitra</code> who is said to have attained this highest title through sheer hard work and dedication (<code>Tapasya</code>).

# Notes 

- We need to justify ourselves to stay alive or else  truth will break our  ego / ID. If all of us see the same truth, we just can't be different. We use reason to do this justification. Reason by design must create at the very least a sense of duality. So that you can pick up your version of the story rather than truth. 
- There are as many shades in a color as many colors on the pallet. Means if you are a part of categorized list , then all those categories live in you as well. Their percentages may vary but you essentially represent every other category as any other category does. Thus seeing the truth is difficult. 
- Duality lives in the information. Knowledge is just one. Karm Yoga is a way to be one with knowledge so that you can see only True version of information. Means single Truth.

- You may say it is a circular self fulfilling prophecy -

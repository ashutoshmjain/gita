<center><h1> 1.1</h1></center> 

In last section we skimmed over the idea that the physical universe is perpetual. There is no beginning or an end. However, we find that in both,  science as well as popular religions,  there appears to be a distinct start of the physical universe. We dont't know for sure if this bigbang was an inelligent design or it oo was an evolutionary act ; but one hing is pretty sure that we can't deny - that we were born on a specific date and time. And we will sure die some day. There is no denial to this harsh reality because this phenomenan is our under vigil - 24 by 7 - it is our single longest observaion. 


In fact , over last few decades, the debate about science v/s religion has reduced to "Evolution v/s Intelligent Design". The primary evolutionary argument is that things don't follow a  pre-decided grand design but over millions of years , the natural selection forced the survival of the "fittest", that led to the world we have. On the other hand religion has become synonymous to the idea that someone external - say God, runs this walled garden . The argument on this side is normally that the beauty and complexity of this magnitude can't just be a mere accident ; it needs active management. 

The best way to understand and harmonize this conflict is to closely look at  our physical reality .. Our tiny box as we discussed in last section as well as the true physical reality. 

## Our Tiny Box

If we see closely as to what we perceive, there are two types of systems in our sensory reality. The physical systems that we can perceive with our senses - we can touch or feel ; for example the earth as part of the solar system, or even the tiny molecular and atomic particles that we can observe through our extended senses. From extended senses I mean the instruments and apparatus of science. Most of the science is study of such physical systems. Gravity , Quantum Mechanics , Laws of motion ; all pertain to these physical systems. 

On the other side we have meta-physical systems. These systems are based out of some physical system but we extend them further. For example a class room is based on physical four walls of a room in our primary school, but a class is lot more than just a room. It is a place for learning , networking and so many more things. These systems don't follow the laws of Newton. And we spend most of our lives in these mental constructs. 

## Our circular physical Reality. 

The most obvious fact about our physical reality is that everything and everyone pulls everything else towards its center. Newton named it Gravity. Gravity is a fundamental force. This constant and impartial pull towards the center, gives everything a circular shape. Or a spherical shape if we want to see it in three dimensional model. Effectively in a large enough physical system, once we reach an equilibrium of some sort everything becomes spherical. We see it in planets , stars , galaxies and even in black holes. We know for sure that central pull exists no matter the size or shape. 

Inherent in this notion (of gravity)is the idea that we are also being pulled by everything else. Towards their center.  The existence of two such forces - inwards ; what we call centripetal force and outwards what we know as centrifugal force is a hallmark of every physical system. 

This outwards pull is what gives the stars and planets their orbits or their identity because otherwise they will just fall into the central one. Lighter things revolve or rotate around more more massive things. Thus the notion of a system in which everything is rotating around itself and also around something else. Planets rotate around sun. Sun rotates around a massive black hole at the center of the milky way and who knows milky way is rotating around some super massive black-hole. 

There is nothing in this universe that is not circling around itself and around something else .  We know for sure now there are massive black holes at the center of pretty much all the galaxies that make them go round and round. Now in physical systems, we might see some particles or say some meteorites, that don't seem to obey this rule . They seem to be on their path but we know sooner or later they will merge into a planet or a star. Even the photons (light) shall bend around if the gravity is strong enough - say a black hole. 

Even in the meta physical systems - say a class room. A teacher is the central force . In a family mom holds the strings together. In a nation there are governments as the central force and in business there is always a nasty boss looking over our shoulders :-) In a way , the meta physical systems are not that different from the physical systems. They may not appear to have a spherical shape but the very idea that there is a central agency, means they are spherical in nature. If we try to represent a top down model geometrically , we will end up into a circle on a 2 dimensional paper. In essence a circle or a sphere is the most probable configuration of our systems.

## Our Sensory Reality 

Contrasting this obvious motion and gravity  is the most amazing trick that our  senses play on us. We never feel this circular motion with our senses. I don't feel that I am rotating around the center of earth at say thousand miles per hour. I never see myself rotating around my own axis :-). This clearly means that my experience is boxed into something different from the underlying truth. In a way, I have shaped a pseudo stable reality around myself that ignores the fundamental forces of nature. Well , you had say that isn't it obvious because the things around us are moving at the same speed. Just like we don't feel the speed inside an aircraft or a train . True, and that is exactly what I am saying. We are designed to feel and appreciate only what is around us . In our vicinity; our tiny box. If we were to know the motion of entire universe, our heads might explode. Evolution has designed us to focus on a very narrow slice of physical reality. Or we can say we dramatically inflate our immediate vicinity. 

In a meta-physical sense, I am clinging on to a chosen reality that I deem good for my survival and I want to maintain a status quo. Oblivious to the true  nature of the universe, I spend enormous effort to maintain what I think I  have ; instead of what I should do. Clinging to this tiny reality vs using it for a purpose is the key difference that Gita highlights as a differentiator between righteous actions and the bondage.

If this is so, the question is what is the purpose of our  pseudo stable reality ? There must be a good reason for us to chase survival. There does exist a central pull in every system that we can refer to as God but then why do we have autonomy to maintain our identities ? The simple answer is nature is allowing us to build the skills. Skills to serve a purpose. In a way , our immediate reality is our training and testing ground. It is the launch  pad that enables us seek the deeper truth.  In essence God is important because that is the entire system as we refer to as `Bramha` in Gita, but we have autonomy in our immediate reality . And that is what we need to focus on. And this reality is always evolving.

I guess this gives a little clue as to how Gita harmonizes the idea of intelligent design and evolution. A design that provides us a huge blank slate of this universe and the basic rules and atop that it adds autonomy to personalized identities to evolve in random directions. We can choose a direction or kinda navigate ourselves on a specific path . Think of it as our massive electrical grid. Electricity has rules that are same for everyone. At 220 volt it will shock and burn the hell out of a naked touch - design ; but we can make anything out of it. We can evolve an air-conditioner out of it - Evolution. 

Okay, the purpose of our pseudo reality is clear, but then one might ask , how do we create it ? To understand this, we need to spend few minutes on the notion of "Time". Gita refers to it as `Kaal Chakra` and it is key to understanding formation of our meta-physical reality and in addition it also explains the idea of  "evolution" and ever evolving call for actions - `Karma`. 


### Time 

In fact the very idea of time is generated out of the circular motion we discussed. A day is completion of a circle around the axis of earth. An year is a completion of circle around the sun. The predictable repeatability of events means existence of circle. The very tic tic of the watch symbolizes a circular motion. In fact in science, the better way to express time is in terms of degrees of rotation. For example in last one hour while you were reading this book , earth rotated fifteen degrees on its axis - 360 degrees of circle in 24 hours means fifteen degrees per hour. The important thing however is that in this one hour, due to motion of millions and billions of stars, everything changed. In fact, every second , everything changes. Thus, time is a measure of change. 

### Observation

And that is what leads to the idea of "observation". Observation is nothing but holding on our senses (or extended senses) on an object to measure the change. It always has a distinct start and distinct end. If we start focusing our senses on a specific object repeatedly , for longer and longer duration , this is what becomes the "desire". A multitude of such desires is what makes our time appear linear - as in arrow of time. For example we are always watching our body ; In a way , the observation for survival never ends till we physically die. In a way our time starts with our birth and ends with our physical death. And millions of other smaller timelines with in this one long desire to survive. 

On the other hand if our observations are infinitely small ; means we observe things as they appear and leave them as they disappear; then we should be able to see our circular reality ! Isn't it ? In a way our senses coupled with desires create the illusion of linearity of time . Let us see what is the take of modern science on the nature of time. 

Stephen Hawking in his best seller "Universe in a Nut Shell" , argues and asks everyone  to devote more attention to understand the concept of "Imaginary Time" . Wick's rotation to an imaginary frame of reference ,  is a well established mathematical concept that when applied to real time, depicts that the time is actually spherical and for our type of universe it needs to be flat on the poles just like the north and south poles of earth. In essence time and space are pretty similar in a four dimensional space-time model what we call Mikownski Space. The details of imaginary time are obviously beyond the scope of this article but I highly recommend (as recommended by Mr Hawking himself) to explore the nature of time. 

Thus we can say that desires reshape our reality. This reshaped reality is our identity. We identify ourselves with the body because that is what we are continuously observing. In addition we identify with friends, family , race , religion , nations , work and so many other things because that is what we are observing. Gita says - this extended identity - `Ahemkara` leads to three other bugs - fear , anger and jealously and together with ego and desires - they create the notion of "Matrix".

So , I guess it is quite clear that we must weed put all the desires if we want to see the underlying true reality. Most religious philosophies and even the common sense would mandate that we cut down our desires and thus action driven by sensory indulgence . Renunciation seems like the best way forward to attain the state of oneness with our true nature. Gita says that this path doesn't work. Instead Gita suggests `Yazna` as the path forward. That brings us to the fundamental question  - What is `Yazna`

### Yazna

Let us say you want to research on cellular biology. You want to understand it inside out. I guess you will grow the cells in a lab. May be from stem cells or some other tissue depending on what aspect you wanna study. It is almost impossible to understand cellular mechanism without having a real cell in your lab. And obviously, you need a lab. A lab is a place where you can remove all the external interactions. You can create a focused environment to study the scope you have in your experiment.

Think of `Yazna` as one of such focused environment that we create to figure out true nature of underlying reality. `Yazna` has many aspects but the core of it is building a skill - doing all the things that you will otherwise do to build a skill in real life but doing so without attachment to worldly expectation. Why ? Because we want to remove all the "desires" from this particular observation. We want to see what happens if we take an elongated observation without the influence of desires. We will talk in great length about the skill building aspect of he `Yazna` in the section on  "Practice and Skills"  ; suffice to say here that Krishna says .. 

> Yajna-arthaat [Done for the sake of Yajna] Karmanah [actions] Anyatra [otherwise] Lokah [world] Ayam [this] Karm-Bandhnah [bondage by work];
>
> Tat [For it] Artham [for the sake] Karm [righteous actions] Kaunteya [O son of Kunti] Mukt-sangh [liberated from the curse of association] Samachara [do dexterously and balanced].

> Things that we do for the sake of `Yazna` - What we should be doing - our ever evolving prescribed set of duties are `Karma`. Rest everything is a bondage to the pseudo reality. Thus do your  actions, liberated from the curse of association and with equanimity.

In a way , the very definition of `Karma` is the actions that we undertake to accomplish a `Yazna`. 

Coming back to our example of cellular biology. If I question why are you conducting the experiment in the first place. May be you want to bring out vaccine for Covid. May be you want to solve the mystery of cancer. May be you just want to understand how the cells actually work. The first two are called `Sakaam Yazna`. The last one , where you only crave for the truth is called `Nishkaam Yazna` - A `Yazna` without desires. You may say there is still a desire. A desire to know the truth . And you are right in your assessment. Even `Nishkaam Yazna` has an underlying desire for true knowledge but given that we already have a physical body ; we can't reach a state of `No desire` unless we know the truth. Thus this last desire is a valid one - the desire to know the our inner self. Our own copy of true knowledge. 

Krishna says in chapter 18 verse 66 

> Sarva Dharman Parityajya Mam Me Ekam Sharnam Vraza ;
>
> Abandon all varieties of religions and science , just focus on me. Me being the one whose copy exists in you. Thus just focus on your internal knowledge - your `Atma`. 

### History repeats

The notion that time is spherical or measure of a rotational change means that history repeats itself though always with a new(er) set of circumstances. No matter how long we hold illusion of arrow of time, the underlying shape is circular. Which means we can leverage the skills we develop but each time with a new set of challenges. Thus building skills is a useful exercise. Gita says building the skills is collection of something called `Daivy Sampad` - divine wealth. The  system - `Bramha` can assign you certain tasks only if you have some skills. That is very easy to understand. In our workplace , we get to do specific jobs based on what are our skills. If you are a good coder , you will get to code. If you are a good writer , you will get to write the  documentation :-) . Again, this is not to say one skill is better than other. All the skills are equally important. In the bigger universe, insects breed to clean up the mess, then other species evolve to clean up the insects. Thus evolution is about application of skills based on new set of realities. 

Krishna says , with the skills that we build through `Yazna` , we must participate in the worldly activities. The skills are built not to renounce everything , they are there to implement righteous actions. He says .. 


> Evam [thus] Pravartitam [ ever evolving ] Chakram [ cycle] Na [ no] Anuvartaytih [ adapts and practices; follows] Iha [ in this life] Yah [ one who];
>
> Agha-Aayuh [ whose life is full of misconduct] Indriya-aaramo [ satisfied and seeker of sense gratification] Mogham [ uselessly] Parth [ Arjuna] Sah [ that person] Jeevati [ lives].
>
> Thus , one who doesn't follow or adapts and practices this ever evolving cycle the way it is meant to be ; such a person , full of misconduct and seeker of sensory gratification, lives uselessly because all such a person is trying to do is stick to he sensory identity rather than serving a call for action. 

To sum it up and recap , Gita says that our senses are there to provide us a virtual world to hone our skills. Our goal is to develop the skills based on our opportunities in this tiny box. We test and apply these skills in this virtual world but the process of attaining these skills and their application, makes us aware of the underlying cyclic nature of universe - both at physical as well as meta physical levels. In other words, perfecting our game means exit from the game. In that it says that renunciation is good if it is done to focus on your skill building pursuit - Yazna. But renunciation doesn't help if we are trying to run away from our virtual reality - such a renunciation doesn't attract any distinct success. A deep appreciation of our physical reality is paramount to develop the skills and their application. 

Once we develop the skills, and we build innate capability to apply those skills based on new challenges, the assignment of duties gets automated. Thus , evolution automatically assigns us deliverables. We need not chase or worry about what is our righteous goal. Our job is focus on building our capabilities. 

Not only assignment of duties gets automated, even the deliverance comes natural to us as soon as we are ready with our skills. And most importantly, Krishna is there to hold our hands if we falter. We don't feel as if we need to do anything special. The entire process becomes effortless. At this stage we are in unison with the universe. We understand the true reality and we appreciate the beauty of our virtual world. We seek actions and we attain peace. Gita says .. 


> Yah [ one ] Tu [ but ] Atma-ratih [ busy in self ] Eva [ certainly ] Syat [ stays, remains ] Atma-triptah [ satiated  ] Cha [ and ] Manvah [ human ];
>
> Aatmni [ In herself ] Eva [ only ] Santushtah [ satisfied ] Tasya [ for her ] Karyam [ work,, duty ] Na [ does not ] Vidyte [ exists ] .
>
> But one who is busy in herself and stays satiated ; satisfied in herself building the necessary skills, for her there is no feeling of duty . The deliverables and the delivery is automatic. Even building the skills is natural to such a person. 

`Karm Yoga` is the way  to attain this self satiated and satisfied state. 

### Beyond our virtual and physical reality - the unmanifested. 

Now you may say how this all started ? What was there before these physical or meta physical systems came into being. Or what if there is no identity and no control. How do things look like when there are no opposite forces ? It is a difficult question because such a state is beyond our manifested realm. Physicists are trying to answer this for ever. I guess we are settled that in our manifested world, both God and Evolution coexist ; God as the core system , as the rules and constants of our physical reality and evolution as our ever evolving pseudo realities; but the question is what was before God or evolution . How did we become One from Zero? One universe held together by a strange force and still evolving at every single level of physical as well as meta-physical. The problem is our scientific models break down at the stage. We can't foresee or perceive what was there before the beginning of time.

The fact that we live in a four dimensional space time is a foregone conclusion . There is no debate on this in scientific community. But what is interesting is even with this additional dimension, science can't really explain what was there before time. Stephen Hawkings rightly says that this an invalid question because our notion of manifested fails when we talk  of something before time. In fact , quantum field theory suggests that the sub atomic particles manifest out of a quantum field. Of course we can't perceive that quantum field with our extended senses, From extended I mean all the tools and apparatus of physics can't perceive the quantum field. There is no observable element out there. And then mathematics delves into a multi dimensional meta verse that is obviously beyond our extended observatories. On last count we have have eight tiny curled up dimensions and three that extend spatially to almost infinity . At this stage science appears even more mysterious than the wildest claims on the religious side. In fact on religious side the definition appears much more elegant. The principals of non-duality says that this thing that is before and beyond the manifested , is just one "un-manifested". Thus the idea of non dual. In Hindu scriptures we call this concept `Advaita` - One undivided. Non-dual. 

The important thing is to keep in mind that Duality and Non-Duality are NOT opposite to each other as they may appear in the name. Duality is about our manifested world. The opposite forces in both physical and meta-physical world. The day and the night. The life and death. The happiness and the pain. The God and the evolution. In fact the duality is in the foundations of modern science. Heraclitus called it in dialectic of "Coincidentia Oppositorum" . On the other hand non-duality is about the oneness of un-manifested. It deems that un-manifested as our only true nature and all that we see around is a mere shadow. It says that time as we perceive is a mere reflection of our thoughts and space is a creation of our senses. And the actions we perceive we are taking. Kinda another extreme end of philosophy.

Gita says this is a perpetual continuum between manifested and un-manifested . It has no beginning or end. This too , is in fact a circle. To symbolize this Krishna  bears a circular `Chakra` on his little finger as the only weapon that he needs. In Hindu mythology `Chakra` is the most potent of weapons. Nothing can withstand it. Nothing can destroy it. It also symbolizes that our physical reality is as real as as the un-manifested. There is no reason to think of one as superior to other. 

If everything is circling about itself and rotating around something central in the physical world, and there is a perpetual cycle from  un-manifested to physical and vice versa; then how do we define freedom or peace? Before we know the path to exit , we need to know what is the meaning of exit, `Nirvana`. We know for sure that natural impulse to manifest is as strong as the impulse to be one with the cosmic if not more. Gita says that the exit from this cycle is in the knowledge of this perpetual cycle. We don't need to destroy our beautiful physical reality in pursuit of one-ness with the un-manifested. Nor do we need to accelerate the process of manifestation. All we need to do is find the perfect balance. And attaining such a  balance is possible only when we truly feel the knowledge inbuilt to us.

At the same time the knowledge allows us to know that our physical reality is temporary. In essence the knowledge makes us play this circle like a game, without getting attached to it . Thus we can enjoy the motion and attain the lasting peace while performing righteous actions. 

### What do you believe in ?

Coming back to our conversation on the beginning of universe. Intelligent design or Evolution. Or a continuum between manifested and beyond manifested. The more important point is "Do we believe in something?" . Believing is quite different from the blind faith. If we believe in something , doesn't really matter what  , we are in the same camp. The other camp is who do not believe in anything. If we "believe" we are saying there is a question, and there is "a" or "many" answers out there that need to be found. We can believe in "Evolution" or we can start with "Intelligent Design" ; if we conduct our experiments carefully, and assuming there is only one definition of "Truth" , all believers will reach the same conclusion. Non believers- well they won't even start on the quest till they start believing in something. Thus "believing in" is a pre-requisite for the journey. Krishna says that fastest way exit from the cycles is to believe in ourselves. Our own protected and immutable knowledge because we are what we believe in. 

Krishna puts this idea very eloquently in chapter seventeen of Gita. He says

> Sattvanurupa Sarvasya, Shradha Bhavati Barata; 
>
> Shrddha-mayo yam Purusho, yo yat shraddha sa eva sah.

Means the humans evolve their beliefs according to their nature and nurture. We are believers and we are what we believe in. This also means that we are seekers and we always seek the truth. Which also means that any debate on "my faith being right and yours not" is pretty useless. 

### What we know for sure.. 

We know for sure that things work in unison in this perpetual universe. And most of it[universe] is well automated. The car runs: We only turn the ignition and press the paddle. This is not to say that we do nothing. We continuously expand the decrypted knowledge. Our purpose is to decrypt the knowledge. And the best way to do that is to first understand what we are extending. What is our current immediate reality. 

The simple question that every rational being must ask, how and why all this is made available to us ? Who did it? We can name it an "accident". We can attribute all this to a chance. Or even call it "evolution". Those all are convenient terms to "black box" what we don't know. We can hide the unknown under evolutionary rug, but we just can't deny that we are very lucky to be here. Millions of cards must have fallen in right places. Thus we need to perform our set of actions to help push the boundaries in whatever field we are. The knowledge is not limited to the scientists on the bleeding edge. In fact every single skill is equally important. 

### Quest is eternal 

Long before modern science took current shape, humans asked this question. They asked why the sun shows up ? Why weathers change? We now have better explanations but as Richard Feynman once put it "why" can only be explained to a certain degree subject to the knowledge of asker and the explainer. At some point, after peeling few layers, we find there are infinitely many more layers and any attempt to further explain is counter productive. At some stage, we must accept there is more to it than we can fathom. The spirituals named it "God". The biologists call it evolution, the physicists and mathematicians have yet better name - they call it "probability".


The point here is we can't find the true answer ..Yet.   There is a journey we must complete before we get down to writing the answers. Gita says that journey is `Karm Yoga`.

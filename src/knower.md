# Knower

In Chapter 13 of the Bhagavad Gītā, Krishna tells Arjuna that the body (and by extension, the entire universe) is the "field" (*kṣetra*), and the one who understands this field is the "knower of the field" (*kṣetrajña*).

> He then says, "Know Me as the Knower in every field."

This essay seeks to understand the characteristics of the "Knower" by bridging modern physics, computing, and ancient Vedic philosophies—Sāṃkhya and Advaita Vedanta. At the very outset, it is a rather ambitious task, because knowing the knower is somewhat like trying to wrap your mind around the idea of the divine creator—God!

## Sāṃkhya

While the bulk of Sāṃkhya and Advaita are overlapping, the core difference is in the boundary conditions—origin and dissolution. The Sāṃkhya school of thought considers an ever-perpetual duality of Prakriti and Purusa—the potential and the observer; while Advaita considers a definite beginning (and end) from a singularity, albeit a cyclic regeneration and demise.

Let us understand the core concepts with Sāṃkhya because this path is easy for the scientifically predisposed mind, and it satisfies the question that haunts both science and religion: "What was there before the universe began?"

### Knowledge vs. Information

To understand the Knower, we must first understand what is meant by "knowledge." The easiest way to comprehend it is to contrast knowledge with information. While conventional definitions often see "information" as a tool to predict the near-term future and "knowledge" as concrete reality, we will flip these definitions to align them with the probabilistic quantum world:

*   **Information** is the data from events that have already occurred—the outcomes of repetitive trials. If you flip a coin a million times, the record of 500,000 heads and 500,000 tails is *information*. It is concrete and pertains to the past. In Sāṃkhya, this is called *Bhūtādika* (Manifested realities of the past).
*   **Knowledge** is the awareness of all possibilities *before* an event happens, and their respective probabilities. The understanding that a coin *can* land on either heads or tails with a 50/50 probability is *knowledge*. The probability of an electron spinning up or down in a perfect vacuum is exactly like a coin toss—fifty-fifty. If the electron cloud somehow retains this "ability of prediction," then we deem the cloud knowledgeable. If some external observer develops this capability, then that external observer is the "knower." In essence, knowledge is the menu of potential futures—it is a way of framing "what to look for" or "what to measure." In Sāṃkhya, this is called *Prārabdha* (the destiny that is yet to unfold but is quite certain how it shall unfold—the likely scenarios).

To put the idea of "knowledge" in context, let's look at the Bhagavad Gita. Krishna suggested a binary option to Arjuna: if you die in the war, you shall gain exit (Nirvana); if you win, you will enjoy the vast kingdom. However, he clarified that "not fighting" is not an option because even if Arjuna were to decide not to fight, his nature would force him into it. War was "Prarabdha." Krishna is seen as the "knower" because he not only knew the options that fate had on offer, but that the choice of this probability distribution was applicable only to Arjuna—not to the hundreds of thousands of other warriors—and also that this choice opened up conditionally once the manifest reached the battle of Kurukshetra. The Gita had to be told only after reaching the middle of the battlefield.

> Even if it may conflict with formal epistemology, for the sake of this essay, "Knowledge" is the set of rules governing the probabilities and prerequsite conditions, while information is the record of manifested reality.

For an external observer, the Knowledge unfolds with every new trial. For example, if it was your first time flipping a coin, you would soon realize that Heads and Tails is the only pair of options, and they happen randomly. But there is an order in that randomness - if you flipped enough times, the occurance of Heads and Tails are more or less same. Amazing thing is this knowledge is inherrent to the "coin flipping experiment". No one ever told the coin how to behave. The unfolding of knowledge (for an observer) is thus akin to "decrypting" a puzzle. It is as if knowldge was encoded into randomness of possibilities. There is no way to understand how a (complex) system would behave other than observing it diligently. The pattern always emerges amidst the apparent chaos. There are rules at play that ordinary conscious observer such as us humans are unaware of.


### The Act of Observation

This is where Quantum Mechanics provides a crucial insight. It is common knowledge that an act of measurement collapses the wave function of a quantum system into a unique state. Here, Prakriti—an equilibrium of potential—manifests one step at a time through the proximity of Purusa, an eternal but random observer. This observer, in both QM and Sāṃkhya, need NOT be "conscious" - it is just an act of measurement.

> While the concept of Prakriti is well understood in science in terms of all the possibilities—a quantum system—the idea of an elementary observer particle is rather mysterious. Why should purusa seek to observe? What makes it take random measurements?
>
> The Sāṃkhya's answer is profound. It says Purusa wants to know, "Who am I?" It is searching in Prakriti for a scenario to describe itself. This quest is not a conscious choice—it is a fundamental property. This is what separates Purusa and Prakriti. Prakriti is "all possibilities" because it doesn't seek anything; Purusa is the fundamental observer because it wants to seek itself.

Lets park the question of observer's motivation for now. The answer will emerge as we delve deeper into the topic. For now, whatever be the reason, the collapse of a wave function leads to a manifestation (i.e., information). The manifest gives us concrete knowledge about the nature of underlying potential. Many trials harden the knowledge into exact probabilities. Knowledge is now decrypted—that the wave function is an electron, the conditions are a vacuum, and the probability of an up or down spin of  electron is fifty-fifty. Once this knowledge is decrypted, a small piece of the entire knowledge is said to be decrypted. It is like solving one piece of a huge jigsaw puzzle. But the question remain, why do things manifest when we make an observation? Quantum Field Theory uses the word "decoherence" to describe this phenomenon. The universe that we see is result of decohrenec. Science is pretty good at describing what happens but "why" is bit fuzzy. 

Sāṃkhya provides a rich mechanism for this play (decoherence) through the inter-operations of the three Gunas:

> The quantum state of Prakṛti is defined by three **guṇas**: *Sattva*, *Rajas*, and *Tamas*. This might seem as if Sāṃkhya posits only a three-dimensional quantum space, but the idea of the three guṇas represents a Hilbert space (of complex functions) in infinite dimensions. How? Because "Gunas" are descriptors—not the possibilities themselves:
>
> *   ***Tamas*** represents all possibilities. This is a state of zero self-awareness, sometimes described as inertia or darkness because it is a state of perfect, undifferentiated chaos. This state is also called "action-less."
>
> *   ***Rajas*** represents the motivation to discriminate, choosing a duality from the chaos of Tamas. It is the state of doubt or internal struggle because it presents a choice but can't make one. In essence, **Rajas offers a choice to the observer**.
>
> *   ***Sattva*** represents resolution—the choice of one option from the binary pair presented by Rajas. It overcomes duality and leads to manifestation.

To make the idea of the Gunas digestible, let us look at an example. Let's say Tamas is the set of all the colors. In this state of Prakriti, all colors exist as pairs of opposites—e.g., Black and White is one pair. Rajas chooses one pair for Purusa to observe. It discriminates all the other possibilities through its industrious nature. Sattva then identifies Purusa with either Black or White—the choice of a scalar option out of the duality.

When Sattva makes a resolute measurement, Puruṣa gets entangled in the middle of the decoherence it caused due to act of measurement. It gets stuck - attention gets locked. This entangled manifestation is a "knot." In Vedic terms, this is the fundamental bondage of observation—**Chakshu Bandhana**. The very act of observation is a bondage at this level, different from the **Karmic Bondage** we normally refer to in traditional Vedic teachings. This concept is easily understood through an example of AI LLMs: 

> In an LLM, all the "words" (tokens) are suspended in 1000s of dimensions. They are aligned based on their dot product - the word "cap" is aligned closer to the word "hat". But there is a separate algorithm called "attention mechanism". The prompt that we give to LLM, runs through the attention mechanism. Attention clubbed with vast model of trained tokens then probablistically renders one word at a time to provide response to your prompt. In this example - think of prakriti as the state of LLM , and purusa as the attention mechanism. When potential and attention join together they manifest an artifact. The only difference is in our quantum computer of parakriti and purusa , the manifests are the real things while in LLMs it a poem or cat pics :-)

The scripture states that the cycle of Prakṛti begins in a state of Tamas (pure equilibrium). The proximity of Puruṣa creates an excitation, giving rise to Rajas, which leads to a definitive option out of millions of possibilities —a vibration of duality - "to be or not to be." Sattva then resolves this by selecting one side of the duality. This is where Puruṣa's attention gets locked into a scalar (non-dual) state of Prakṛti, which is then called the "manifest." The other side of the chosen duality holds the knowledge. For example, if the manifest is "Heads," then the knowledge is the awareness that "I am not Heads." This means that the probability of "Tails" in the next trial increases by one vote. In the next trial, Sattva is likely to choose a "Tail" for the observer, but if it didn't, "Tails" now has two extra votes.

This is how the threefold Gunas control the probability of what is going to happen, but that is not all—the system turns into massive computer hardware.


### The Universal Computer - Mahat

Let us look at the operation of the Gunas once again. This time we shift our vantage to Prakriti—we notice that the potential is ever-present. As soon as a manifestation happens (Purusa combines with one of the possibilities), Prakriti is back into a Tamasic state, except this time the probabilities have changed because of additional information. In a way, it is a self-learning switch because the knowledge is inherent in the perfect chaos. By the way, we should at this point wonder why 100-coin flips automatically result in fifty "Heads" and fifty "Tails." How does the flipping coin know its next move? This is exactly why the idea of three Gunas appear real - there is something in repeated trails of a system that remembers the past and predicts the future. 

In essence, every time an electron with an up-spin is detected, the electron cloud is back in a quantum state to create a spin-down electron. All it needs is the attention of Purusa.

This flipping of the wave function—between an up and down electron or the flipping of a coin into "Heads" or "Tails"—is not limited to binary choices. A function may represent thousands of possibilities and an intricate balance of respective probabilities.

> This universal quantum computer is referred to as Mahat in Sāṃkhya-speak.

### The Rise of Identity (Ahaṃkāra)

The Mahat is thus a computer, but it is capable of producing real stuff—not just mere poems or answers to your questions - it does that too but for that we might just use our simple computer :-) But even our universal quantum computer, as grand as it may be, does need attention. The question is, where does attention come from? How does Purusa arrive at the scene?

The answer is surprisingly simple: the physical stuff (the information) that Mahat creates cobbles together to form complex patterns. These patterns aspire to know what they are! But the questions are rarely at the level of subatomic particles, just the way we don't ask an individual transistor to flip into 0 or 1.

Ahmkara is thus a layer over Mahat that lets manifested stuff identify itself.This higher level of abstraction represented by an Identity asks "who am I". This is what supplies the attention to the underlying system. The role of Ahemkara is like "attention mechanism" of AI LLM example. It translates the prompts of an identity, into thousands of questions for our underlying quantum switches. Some of them resolve the color, other the smell, some more create new matter. More questions Identites ask , more manifestation happens and consequently more knowledge gets decrypted. 

In essence, the real world that we see around us (information) collectively, is a mirror image of of the decrypted knowledge. 

### The Random Observer

The way Ahamkara observes Mahat is through random sampling. This behavior of random questioning at an abstract level is called Manas—the fickle mind. Randomness is a necessity of the system, but to us, it appears as an inability to focus.

### The Evolution of Consciousness

The obvious next step in evolution is to support the fickle mind with tools to observe Prakriti with a focus on the condition of the physical world—the dynamic circumstances of the vicinity. The tools to measure reality—the sensors—are called Indriyas—our sensors—the eyes, ears.

The observer, now equipped with senses (*indriyas*) to assess the environment, then develops the action organs to protect those senses. This is how the observer becomes a fully interactive but bound agent.

This state of vigilance is called consciousness. Consciousness drives survival and aspires to the longevity of a manifestation, but the downside is that "knowledge" becomes encrypted to conscious beings. Why? Because the purpose of conscious beings is to engage with manifested reality. The flipping nature of the underlying universal computer has access to all knowledge, but this knowledge is invisible. Think of a conscious being as a user of a complex computer. It can ask for the next step but doesn't know how the machine truly works.

In essence, the entangled observer becomes a part of an organization to drive efficiency. You should not do the work I have already done. We can define our separate roles to scan the surroundings. These rules give rise to ever-improving communication within conscious beings. Standardization is key to communication. This is the rise of "Intelligence." While Intelligence represents communication, Knowledge becomes a method of value exchange for mutual growth. Every piece of communicated information has a value attached. Better rules deserve better value—they attain standardization first.

Consciousness drives centralization and order. This state is the exact mirror image of "knowledge." In a way, it is the chiral manifestation of knowledge. Knowledge, by definition, stays decentralized, watching pure potential. It is the set of assessment rules for manifesting the righteous (the right choice). Consciousness, on the other hand, is the ability to scan the environment for something better. Sometimes, decay is also a better choice. Knowledge is eternal; consciousness is the poster child of the happy matrimony of Purusha and Prakriti.

The formation of Mahat, Ego, and Mind is not a one-time event but a continuous, layered process. With each layer, more knowledge is decrypted into stable reality. As an entangled observer learns, it also develops tools for quantum purification and detachment. In other words, only conscious beings may strive to realize the hidden knowledge of pure potential. These more detached observers then begin to formulate a new, higher-level rulebook over the existing, bonded reality. In essence, information expands as more and more knowledge is decrypted.

This is the engine of evolution. Every new layer is a "quantum jump" in consciousness. Vedic science illustrates this through the incarnations of Vishnu: from the great fish (Matsya) to the tortoise (Kurma), the man-lion (Narasimha), and finally to a complete human (Rama), each representing a new evolutionary layer of intelligence.

### Intelligence, Gravity, and Dark Matter

**Intelligence** is the standard for communication between conscious agents. But knowledge itself has its own communication channel: the geometry of inner space. This geometry, the awareness of manifestation, is **gravity**.

What we perceive as matter is simply decrypted knowledge. The vast amount of knowledge that remains encrypted to our collective still contributes to the total geometry of spacetime. It has a gravitational effect, but it doesn't interact with our senses (or light). This is **dark matter**: the gravitational pull of matter beyond our perception.

## Advaita Vedanta

The difference between Sāṃkhya and Advaita is in the origin of the universe. Sāṃkhya believes in duality—a field of potential and the manifestation of an artifact due to entanglement with an observer. Advaita posits that the universe begins with an extremely small singularity. This is termed as a seed.

To put it visually, imagine the center of a quantum system. Each dimension crossing through this imaginary center is a unique possibility. If there are five lines emanating from the center, the possibility of each is 20 percent. But how do we know there are only five lines? This is where gradual decryption happens. A record of all the observations must be kept. There is, however, no database. The record is in the geometry of the system. If there are five pathways of observation, then the system has five channels falling into the center. If there are infinite possibilities, then in modern science, we call it a quantum system. The key thing here: knowledge is the awareness of the center as to how many possibilities intersect at this point. Each possibility is an equal representation of the one who sits at the center. In essence, the meaning of observation is to look inward from each dimension and see the center as one. You see the same center from all channels. Even infinite possibilities see only one outcome.

> In other words, the simple idea that "knowledge" is the awareness of ONE enables infinite possibilities. This also means knowledge bears the system with a certain number of dimensions—even infinite—with just one rule: See the ONE at the center. The dimensions are decrypted as the awareness of many channels happens, but there is no new thing in adding or removing a dimension. In other words, knowledge is immutable.

Imagine a singularity, a non-dimensional point. The idea of a singularity in the vast space of nothingness (where our physics breaks down) means this point can be anything. No one can imagine the shape of this point because there are no rules. This means an equal chance for all possibilities.

The fundamental question that arises at this stage is: "Who am I?" If the shape can be anything, then what is it? The singularity can visit infinite dimensions to view itself. Every time it ventures into a dimension, it views its own mirror image from a different vantage. One side of the equation is reality, and the other side is the knowledge of the reality.

The key idea is that the singularity visits infinitely many dimensions simultaneously to create a massive reality and a massive record of knowledge. This is what Advaita calls *Visarga*. This is similar to the process of creation in General Relativity, commonly known as the inflationary epoch. Once the initial manifest is created, the rules of Sāṃkhya kick in. Prakriti is embodied with pure potential described by the three Gunas. And observation manifests the features of evolution, but the knowledge is withheld, immutable, with the initial burst. This knowledge is the observer.

Advaita calls this complete knowledge **Brahman**. One who knows Brahman is termed as the Knower.

This process finds its ultimate physical expression at the most extreme objects in the cosmos: black holes. In General Relativity, the center of a black hole is a singularity—a point of infinite density where the laws of physics break down. However, String Theory resolves this by replacing the singularity with a "fuzzball"—a super-dense but finite-sized tangle of all the strings that have fallen in. This fuzzball represents the ultimate state of constrained mass, a physical manifestation of "Knowledge." All information is locked into the black hole in the shape of super-dense mass.

The "knowledge" of this fuzzball—its mass, spin, and charge—is communicated to the universe not by real particles, but by a field of *virtual particles* that surrounds it. These virtual particles are temporary quantum fluctuations that create the gravitational and electromagnetic fields, acting as messengers of the fuzzball's properties. The quantum vacuum around the event horizon is a sea of these virtual particle-antiparticle pairs constantly popping into existence and annihilating.

This is where the universe performs its most profound act of creation. At the event horizon, the intense gravitational pull can separate these virtual pairs. One particle falls into the fuzzball, while the other escapes. The captured particle pays for this separation by reducing the black hole's mass, while the escaping particle is promoted into a *real particle*. This process, known as Hawking radiation, makes the black hole a "Reality Generation Machine." It transforms the unmanifest potential of the vacuum (Prakṛti) into the manifest reality of detectable particles (Information), fueled by the dissolution of the fuzzball. The knowledge eventually spreads into the infinite possibilities of Tamas as the black hole evaporates, and the cycle begins anew.


## The Knower: The Mirror of the Universe

The knowledge held within the geometry of our consciousness is a mirror image of the universe around us. Why? Because the shape of knowledge is the imprint of all manifestations. Our individual knowledge is the accumulation of all our observations, and all observations collectively create our physical reality. This is the "observer effect" scaled up to the cosmos.

This is what Vedic science refers to as **Brahman**. Brahman is both out there and within us. It is the observer and the observed. It is the collective decryption of knowledge by all conscious beings. We each contribute to it with every action and perception in our tiny corner of the universe. Each of us is a vector in the grand Hilbert space of consciousness.

There are two ways to observe Brahman: inwards or outwards. But in truth, it is a cycle. Purification is the inward path. When the observer becomes pure, it is meant to interact with the universe again—to take measurements without becoming entangled. This is **Karmayoga**: finding our purpose and acting on it with detachment.

Krishna's statement, "Know Me as the Knower in every body," is an invitation to this realization. The "Knower" is the one who understands that their individual consciousness is a reflection of the entire cosmic field. It is the one who sees the universe not as something separate, but as the external manifestation of the knowledge held within. To know the field is to know oneself. To know oneself is to know the universe.

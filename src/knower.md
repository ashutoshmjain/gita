# Knower

In Chapter 13 of the Bhagavad Gītā, Krishna tells Arjuna that the body (and by extension, the entire universe) is the "field" (*kṣetra*), and the one who understands this field is the "knower of the field" (*kṣetrajña*).

> He then says, "Know Me as the Knower in every field."

This essay seeks to understand the characteristics of the "Knower" by bridging modern physics and  computing with ancient Vedic philosophies of Sāṃkhya and Advaita Vedānta.

## Sāṃkhya

While the bulk of Sāṃkhya and Advaita are overlapping, the core difference is in the boundary conditions—origin and dissolution. The Sāṃkhya school of thought considers a perpetual duality of Prakriti and Purusha—the potential and the observer. Advaita considers a definite beginning from a non-dual singularity (seed), albeit recurring cycles of sudden demise (Pralaya) and sudden regeneration (Prabhava).

> Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 7.

Let us understand the core concepts with Sāṃkhya because this path is easier for the scientifically-predisposed mind, and it satisfies the question that haunts both science and religion: "What was there before the universe began?". In other words, Sāṃkhya is designed for minds that need logical closure. It is an analytical view of Vedic science. The word "Suṃkhya" in Sanskrit literally means "a number." Sāṃkhya thus means: based in rational logic.

### Knowledge vs. Information

To understand the Knower, we must first understand what is meant by "knowledge"!.

The easiest way to comprehend knowledge is to contrast it with information. 

Conventional definitions often see "information" as a tool to predict next event (say a stock market crash, perfect weather for the beach etc.); and "knowledge" as the concrete universal reality (speed of light is a constant). For this essay, we will flip these definitions to align them with the probabilistic quantum world. Probablity is a useful tool. As observers, our predictive capabilities (of most physical processes) lack certainty. That is exactly where probabilty shines - to handle uncertainty.

*   **Information** is the data from events that have already occurred—the outcomes of repetitive trials. If you flip a coin a million times, the record of say 501,000 heads and 499,000 tails is *information*. It is concrete record of outcomes. It is the past. In Sāṃkhya, this is called *Bhūtādika* (manifested realities of the past). Manifest can be both, physical as well as abstract.
*   **Knowledge** is the awareness of all options and their respective probabilities. For example, the simple idea that a fair coin *may* land on either heads or tails with a ~ 50/50 probability is *knowledge*.

> Knowledge is the menu of potential futures—it is a way to frame "what to look for" or "what to measure." In Sāṃkhya, this is called *Prārabdha* (the destiny that is yet to unfold but we are quite sure of likely scenarios). 
>
> A rather watered down anology would be the example of a casino. In that very limited scope of slot machines and games, a casino has the knowledge as to how much edge it has (per hand), though it can't pick up gains against a specific player. It has control over final outcome but not on individual play. A gambler, on the other hand, is someone who is changing his bets based on the "information" of the individual outcomes - fully aware that probability is stacked against him. This design is useful becuase even though the game is rigged it is not so in favor of a specific player. Even the casino manager can't predict individual hand if she wish to try her own luck. Samkhya thus, despite being puerly rational, permits God to incarnate in this world, albeit such incarnation is as tied to the physical laws as an ordinary player to the rule book of casino - there are no special privelages except for the knowledge.
>
> Knowledge doesn't strive to be accurate in terms of absolute occurrences - heads may be more than tails in a flipping contest, or vice versa - but it is super accurate in large sample size. And that a slight change in conditions immediately changes the odds - without fail. There is no way to bluff the knowledge:  if you throw a dice, it can't just fly to outer space! Or can it? 
>
>> It can. In the truest sprit of probability it can if earth lost its gravity for a split second just when you flipped the coin.  But the pre-existing manifestions - such as gravity of earth - are the pre conditions. They make sure that out of infinite possibilties, only two are permitted - Heads or Tails. All other "Not Heads" or "Not Tails" are constrained by conditioning of our experiment. Awareness of all such preconditions that led to a binary option pair is knowledge.

To put the idea of "knowledge" in context, let's look at the Bhagavad Gītā. Krishna suggested a binary option to Arjuna: if you die in the war, you shall gain exit (Nirvāṇa); if you win, you will enjoy the vast kingdom. Life and death are choices like those in an air-borne flipping coin. However, he clarified that "not fighting" isn't a valid option. The chances of him not fighting were akin to a throw of a dice turning into a banana. Even if Arjuna were to abandon the fight, his conditioning would force him back in. It is in the "geometry" of a coin to be flipped as much as that in the nature of a warrior to fight.

Krishna is seen as the "knower" because he not only knew the options that fate (*prārabdha*) had on offer, but that these choices belonged only to Arjuna—not to thousands of other warriors. And that the options opened up (conditionally) once the manifest reached the battle of Kurukshetra. The Gītā had to be told only after reaching the centerstage, from where entire universe could hear.

> Even if it may conflict with formal epistemology, let us restate the definitions once again:  
>
> For the sake of this essay, "Knowledge" is the set of rules governing the probabilities, while "information" is the record of individual outcomes.

For an external observer, knowledge unfolds with every new piece of information. For example, if it was your first time flipping a fair coin, you would soon realize that Heads or Tails were only options. For a binary pair such as coin toss, "Not Heads" exists but eventually it means "Tails", and vice versa. You can name "Tails" as "Not Heads" depending upon what you are looking for. You would also see that Heads and Tails are random occurrences - independent of what showed up in last flip. But there is an order in that randomness. If you flipped enough times, the occurrences of two options converge towards the average - half and half. If there were three probable outcomes, the outcomes shall gravitate towards "one third". These are proven laws of probability theory but the amazing thing is:  

> No one ever told "the coin" how to behave. It didn't take probability theory lessons :-) Eienstein famously said "God doesn't throw dice". 
>
> Knowledge to maintain an intricate balalnce of outcomes must be pre-embedded somewhere into the geometry of the coin.  Knowledge is something built into apparently chaotic potential. It is the basis for weather patterns to emerge, stock markets to function, from traffiic in busy down town to the orderly flock of birds flying - everything has knowledge prebuilt. Knowledge is the fundamental laws of physics.
>
> The gradual unveiling of knowledge (for an observer) is thus akin to "decrypting" a puzzle through repeated trials and errors.

Knowledge means you build the system inside out, not outside in. While a well "informed" may cite event(s), knowledge is the means to hypothesis. It can predict things or lay down prophecies. Knower is an insider. It is so deeply entrenched that it is invisible even to ardent observers. An observer is collecting information (past), a knower is choosing the direction of future by designating what to observe. 

While potential is perfectly random, "what to observe" creates a narrative - an order emerges. We always look for a Head or Tail in a coin flip. No one is counting banans after flipping a coin.

### The Act of Observation

This is where Quantum Mechanics provides a crucial insight: an act of measurement collapses the wave function.

> A "wave function" is just a fancy way to account for "all the possibilities" (in a mathematical equation). The quantumness, however, is a fascinating idea. It means all the possibilities exist together in a state called "super position". An observation breaks this "possibility cloud" into one unique state. This one chosen possibility is a tiny increment in our reality. It is a concrete event - the information. It is like Monday morning when you were still half asleep imagining it was a lazy Sunday. The weekend quantum dream wouldn't collapse till Alexa announced it was eight a.m. to kickstart the work week, and then it all suddenly gets real! Monday happened.

In Sāṃkhya, the quantum state is represented by Prakriti. Prakriti, an equilibrium of potential, manifests but there is a mandatory requirement: the proximity of Purusha - an eternal but random observer. This observer, in both QM or Sāṃkhya, need not be "conscious" (like a human)—it can be an automated act of measurement. Just the way Alexa, though not conscious, measured your Monday morning to let loose the reality! 

> While the concept of Prakriti is somewhat understood in modern science—all elementary particles (quarks, bosons, electrons, etc.) exhibit quantumness—the idea of an "elementary observer" is conspicuously missing. Why should Purusha seek to observe? What motivates it to take a measurement?
>
> Sāṃkhya's answer is profound. It says Purusha wants to know, "Who am I?" It is searching for a scenario in Prakriti to describe itself. This impulse to "know itself" is what separates Purusha and Prakriti. Prakriti is "all possibilities" because it doesn't seek to know; Purusha is the fundamental observer because it yearns to know itself. 

The collapse of a wave function leads to a manifestation (information). The information, through sheer chance (no genius), may unlock knowledge about the nature of the underlying potential. A tiny part of Knowledge is now decrypted—that the wave belongs to an electron, the conditions are a vacuum, and that the probability of electron spinning up or down, just like our flipping coin, is fifty-fifty. Once this knowledge is decrypted, a small piece of the entire knowledge is said to be decrypted. It is like solving one piece of a huge jigsaw puzzle at a time. Or adding a block to the decrypted knowledge chain. 

But the question remains, how do things manifest when we make an observation? Quantum Field Theory uses the word "decoherence" to describe this phenomenon. The universe that we see is the result of decoherence. Science is pretty good at describing what happens, but "how" is a bit fuzzy. Maybe it is lost in super-complex mathematics. Sāṃkhya, on the other hand, provides a rich mechanism for the play of creation (decoherence) through the inter-operations of the three Gunas. 

The best part: You don't need to be a string theorist to understand this play!

> The quantum state of Prakṛti is defined by three **guṇas**: *Sattva*, *Rajas*, and *Tamas*. This might feel as if Sāṃkhya posits a three-dimensional possibility space (as opposed to two dimensional hilbert space of "Coin Flip") , but the framework of the three guṇas CAN represents infinite dimensions. How? Because "Gunas" are descriptors—not the possibilities themselves.
>
> *   ***Tamas*** represents a state of zero self-awareness, sometimes described as darkness because it is directionless. This state is recognized through its inherent inertia because multiple dualities acting together leave no wiggle room. Important thing to mention here is: Every possibility always comes with a mirror image - "Heads" and "No Heads". These dualities (rather than independent possibilities) are superimposed over each other to form knots. In this state "prakriti" is said to be tied in its own doubts.
>
> *   ***Rajas*** represents the motivation to discriminate, choosing ONE duality from the chaos of hundreds of dualities of Tamas. It is the state of rigor becuase it is untangling the complicated knots, and doubt because it is always dealing with dualities. Finally, if it succeeds, **Rajas picks up one duality and offers a choice to the observer**. In our coin-flipping experiment, choice is not "Heads v/s Tails" - it is  one of two resolutions: "Heads or No Heads" vs. "Tails or No Tails." To make this idea simple, think of yourself as an investor in the stock market. You have thousands of choices.  You can't really make an investment if you want to analyze all the opportunities. This is a state of Tamas-analysis paralysis. Rajas is the grind to finally get you to a place where you want to place all your eggs in, say, a Bitcoin ETF. When you are presented with this choice, you still have a duality: invest or not?
>
> *   ***Sattva*** represents resolution—the choice of one option from the binary pair presented by Rajas. It overcomes duality and leads to manifestation. Continuing with our example, if the duality was "Heads or No Heads," Sattva may choose "Heads." If it chooses "No Heads," then Rajas must provide another duality: "Tails or No Tails." Likewise, Sattva may choose "Tails" at this point or let Rajas keep on grinding the wheels. Think of these as the flips in the air. When the coin finally strikes a hard surface, bounces a couple of times, and settles—that is when we say Sattva took a shape in the manifest - "Prarabdha" happened. And of course, if you are an investor, congratulations—you invested your money in Bitcoin.

The journey of manifestation is thus from many tangled dualities (Tamas) to a single duality (Rajas) to finally one option of the duality (Sattva). The collapse of the wave function means symmetry is broken. One side of the duality turned into real stuff (information), and the other is retained by the system as "Knowledge." Think of it like Casino knows the daily loss or gain of all the slot machines - that awareness keeps validating casino's assumptions. It keeps refining the probabilities whereas individual player has information of a few hands she or her friends played.

When Sattva makes a resolute measurement, Puruṣa gets entangled in the middle of the decoherence it caused. It "gets stuck," and the time begins - which means the time is a measure of how long attention stays locked. In Vedic terms, this is the fundamental bondage of observation—**Bodh Bandhana** - the bondage of awareness. The very state of knowing is a bond at this level, different from the **Karmic Bondage** we normally refer to in traditional Vedic teachings. In some traditions, "not knowing" is considered ultimate freedom. Buddha was often called "BodhiSattva"  because he had freedom from the bond of knowing. Like karmic manifest, time does pass in this bondage - there is a notion of rise and decay - but duration of this bond is exponentially longer. You just can't "unknow" that easily.

BTW, this is exactly how  an AI Large Language Model works: It is a great way to comprehend what QM framework is missing a very important formalism - the observer[^observer]! 

> In an LLM such as Google Gemini, all the "words" (tokens) that are used to train the model are suspended in a vector space of thousands of mathematical dimensions. Of course, these are not real physical dimensions like length or width—they are mathematical dimensions (x, y, and z coordinates).
>
> The whole idea of training a model is to align the vectors (representing the text tokens) based on their meaning - often known as the dot product. For example, the vector for the word "cap" is aligned closer to that of word "hat" and away from the word "cat". The model learns the relationship between words but here is equally important construct: there is another algorithm called the "attention mechanism." The attention mechanism is a separate process that helps the model decide which words in the prompt are most important for generating the next word. It works by weighing input tokens so that relevant ones have more influence on the model.
>
> The prompt that we give to an LLM thus runs through the attention mechanism. Attention, clubbed with the vast model of trained tokens, then probabilistically renders one word at a time to provide a response to your prompt. In this example, think of Prakriti as the trained state of the LLM and Purusha as the attention mechanism. When potential and attention join together, they manifest an artifact. The only difference is that in our quantum computer of Prakriti and Purusha, the manifests are real things, while in LLMs, it is a poem! Or cat pics. :-) Is there really a difference between artificailly generated world and our natural world ? Food for thought but the point here is - at a very generic level - AI works exactly like Sanmkhya model of potential and observer.

The scripture states the cycle has no definitive beginning or end or order becasuse there is no notion of Time before the manifestion occurs. The time (Kala) is an emergent behaviour of the manifested. It is the way we present the information flow - from one event to another. Thus, before the manifestation happens, there is no order of the events. We can start from any state to any state.

Let us assume Prakṛti begins in a state of Tamas (pure equilibrium of knots). The proximity of Puruṣa creates an excitation, giving control to Rajas, which leads to a definitive option pair out of a multitude of possible pairs. Sattva then resolves this by selecting one side of the duality. This is where Puruṣa's attention gets locked into a scalar (non-dual) state of Prakṛti, which is then called the "manifest."

The other side of the chosen duality holds the knowledge. For example, if the manifest is "Heads," then the knowledge is the awareness that "I am not Heads." - just the way you beleive you are not your image in the mirror - yes you two look alike but image is chairal - means left side is right and vice versa. Think of your chiaral image as unmanifested side of your own duality of being - knowledge locked in the system. In QM this idea is represented as "complex conjugate" though much lucid math. If a manifest (particle) is always locked on its image such that the manifest and its image are entangled (for a duartion), such a particle is a spin half particle. It takes 720 degrees for the manifest and its image to take a full circle. Such particles bear attention as mass. You are becuase your attention is locked with your image - it is one system.

This split of physical and knowledge also means the probability of "Not Heads" in the next trial increases by one vote. It is important to be careful here because in classical world every "toss of the coin" is independent of previous toss. We CAN'T icrease the probability of Tails based on the results of past trial, but we can sure increase the probability of a "thing" that is NOT a designated outcome. So "Not Heads" is a way to circumvent the formalisation of probability theory. In truth "Not Heads" in this case is same as Tails becuse there are only two "real" options. In the next trial, thus, Sattva is likely to choose "Tails" for the observer, but if it didn't, "Not Heads" now has two extra votes and thus an even higher probability of "Tails".

> The idea of saying "NOT-HEADS" as the knowledge is a crucial point here. It means "knowledge" may represent a proxy vote in the probablistic disposition of the trial but it can't manifest (in real) on its own. It must take on the shape of "Tails".

Keep in mind that the three Gunas are not some external monitoring system. These are the inherent properties of Prakriti—manifest or unmanifest—just like Quantum systems have three fundamental properties: Charge, Mass, and Spin.

- Sattva <=> Mass (Physical Reality)
- Rajas <=> Charge (Duality)
- Tamas <=> Spin (Quantum degrees of freedom)

This is how the threefold Gunas control the probability of what is going to happen, but that is not all—the system turns into massive computer hardware.

### The Universal Computer - Mahat

The gunas model at its core reduces the multiplicity of quantum states to a biary choice. That makes this quantum apparatus more like a classical computation device. Manifestaion is like a classical transistor in "ON" position where observer is locked in like a tiny spark of current, and the opposite is barren "off" state without any attention.


<div style="padding-left:40px;font-size:0.8em;"> 

Nick Bostrom and Carl Shulman suggest in their [recent paper](https://nickbostrom.com/propositions.pdf) -  consciousness is hardware independent.

> Mental states can supervene on any of a broad class of physical substrates. Provided a system implements the right sort of computational structures and processes, it can be associated with conscious experiences. It is not an essential property of consciousness that it is implemented on carbon-based biological neural networks inside a cranium: silicon-based processors inside a computer could in principle do the trick as well ~ [Propositions Concerning Digital Minds and Society](https://nickbostrom.com/propositions.pdf)

</div>

That raises the question - what exactly is consciousness. The answer is in another question that we left ananswered in the starting paragraphs - why does Purusa wants to know who it is? Consciousness is ability to discriminate between I and the rest - The Identity.


### The Rise of Identity (Ahaṃkāra)

The Mahat is thus a computer, but it is capable of producing real stuff—not just mere poems or answers to your questions. It does that too, but for that, we might just use our simple computer :-) But our universal quantum computer, as grand as it may be, does need attention. Attention is like the electricity. There is no manifestation without the curious observations of Purusha. The question is, where does attention come from? How does Purusha arrive at the scene?

The answer is surprisingly simple though circular: the physical stuff (the information) that Mahat creates from a patternless chaos cobbles together to form complex patterns. Pattern emerges out of randomness. These patterns aspire to know what they are because the very meaning of a pattern is something that could be identified! But the questions are rarely at the level of subatomic particles, just the way we don't ask an individual transistor to flip into 0 or 1.

You may say the logic is cicular because attention can't be there without Identity but Identity can't emerge without attention at the granular level. A chicken and egg situation. This however is not a limitatioin but a proof of the model. As we said earlier Samkhya posits an everlasting play of Prakriti and Purusa. There is no end or no beginning becuase the time itself is an emergent phenomenon of the manifested. Attention is as fundamental a field as the Higgs field - beyond time.

Ahamkara is thus the application paradigm over Mahat that lets manifested stuff recognize itself. This higher level of abstraction represented by an Identity asks, "Sure I have a name, but who I really am? How did I reach here?" The quest "to know who am I" supplies the attention to the underlying system. The role of Ahamkara is like the "inference engine" of the AI LLM example. It translates the prompts of an identity into thousands of questions for our underlying quantum switches. Some of them resolve the color, others the smell, and some more create new matter. The more questions Identities ask, the more manifestation happens and consequently, more knowledge gets decrypted. 

Asking "who am I" is not very different from asking "what is this universe" - it is same as saying Heads is same as "Not Tails". In essence, the real world that we see around us (information) collectively is a mirror image of the collective decrypted knowledge.

### The Random Observer (Manas)

If the goal is to decrypt knowledge from a perfect chaos of potential, the most effective strategy is random sampling. That is where Manas comes into being—the fickle mind. Ahamkara, being the Identity, seeks to know "who am I" and thus supplies attention to the underlying potential, but it must do so in the most random fashion. To better understand this idea, we can look at a real-life example—Bitcoin mining.

> Bitcoin mining uses random sampling—or more precisely, trial and error with the nonce—because of how the proof-of-work mechanism is designed. In Bitcoin mining, miners must find a nonce value such that when it is combined with the block's header and run through the SHA-256 hash function, the resulting hash is below a certain target value defined by the network's difficulty.
>
> The SHA-256 hash function produces output that is **unpredictable and essentially random**. For any given input (including a specific nonce), there's no way to know in advance what the output will be, nor is there a way to get closer to a valid result by choosing nonce values in any particular order. That means each attempt to find a valid nonce is independent—the outcome of the hash function cannot be predicted from previous attempts and does not follow any discernible sequence.
>
> Therefore, miners use the nonce as a **random or incrementing value** to keep generating different block header hashes until one meets the required criteria. This process is purely a guessing game—akin to buying lottery tickets—where miners continuously try different nonce values, sometimes in order and sometimes randomly, hoping to "stumble upon" the right one. If all possible nonce values fail, they change other elements in the block (such as the extra nonce or timestamp) and continue the process.
>
> This approach is fundamental to the **security and fairness** of Bitcoin: it makes the mining process probabilistic and unpredictable, preventing any miner from having a guaranteed shortcut or advantage beyond raw computational power.

Think of Manas as a secure and fair method to determine "Identity," except this means "hard work." We will delve into the connection of this idea with "Karmayoga" in later chapters—suffice it to say here that this hard work provides Rajas its industrious nature to choose one duality out of many possibilities. This also means our minds are designed to chase random desires for us to determine who we are. Controlling the mind is hard. How then can we do something useful with a focused mind? That is where the idea of consciousness comes in—our senses are there to ground us in reality, to make our observations as objective as possible.

### The Evolution of Consciousness

The obvious next step in evolution is to support the fickle mind with tools to observe Prakriti with a focus on the condition of the physical world—the dynamic circumstances of the vicinity. The tools to measure reality—the sensors—are called Indriyas: our senses, the eyes, ears.

The observer, now equipped with senses (*indriyas*) to assess the environment, then develops the action organs to protect those senses. This is how the observer becomes a fully interactive but bound agent.

This state of vigilance is called consciousness. Consciousness drives survival and aspires to the longevity of a manifestation, but the downside is that "knowledge" becomes encrypted to conscious beings. Why? Because the purpose of conscious beings is to engage with manifested reality. The flipping nature of the underlying universal computer has access to all knowledge, but this knowledge is invisible. Think of a conscious being as a user of a complex computer. It can ask for the next step but doesn't know how the machine truly works.

In essence, a conscious being becomes a part of an organization to drive efficiency. You should not do the work I have already done. We can define our separate roles to scan the surroundings. These rules give rise to ever-improving communication within conscious beings. Standardization is key to communication. This is the rise of "Intelligence." While Intelligence represents communication, Knowledge becomes a method of value exchange for mutual growth. Every piece of communicated information has a value attached. Better rules deserve better value—they attain standardization first.

Consciousness drives centralization and order. This state is the exact mirror image of "knowledge." In a way, it is the chiral manifestation of knowledge. Knowledge, by definition, stays decentralized, watching pure potential. It is the set of assessment rules for manifesting the righteous (the right choice). Consciousness, on the other hand, is the ability to scan the environment for something better. Sometimes, decay is also a better choice. Knowledge is eternal; consciousness is the poster child of the happy matrimony of Purusha and Prakriti.

The formation of Mahat, Ego, and Mind is not a one-time event but a continuous, layered process. With each layer, more knowledge is decrypted into stable reality. As an entangled observer learns, it also develops tools for quantum purification and detachment. In other words, only conscious beings may strive to realize the hidden knowledge of pure potential. These more detached observers then begin to formulate a new, higher-level rulebook over the existing, bonded reality. In essence, information expands as more and more knowledge is decrypted.

This is the engine of evolution. Every new layer is a "quantum jump" in consciousness. Vedic science illustrates this through the incarnations of Vishnu: from the great fish (Matsya) to the tortoise (Kurma), the man-lion (Narasimha), and finally to a complete human (Rama), each representing a new evolutionary layer of intelligence.

### Intelligence

**Intelligence** is the standard for communication between conscious agents. Every layer of conscious beings develops its own set of sensors to perceive reality. Not only the successive layers, but within each layer, there can be millions of conscious beings to perceive reality differently. For example, dogs perceive reality differently than we humans. Bats have a totally different take on reality. Accordingly, they develop action organs to protect the senses. Since the whole point is to drive efficiency in understanding the overall decrypted knowledge, it is very important to communicate with each other. These standards of communication are what we call intelligence.

The important thing to note here is that within each species, the meaning of reality may be very different. For example, I may perceive the color green very differently than you, but it works as long as we both point to the same color as green. Thus, intelligence (a.k.a. communication) is detached from reality. It is just a way to express information. No wonder abstract things such as love are harder to communicate than ground reality.

The origin of intelligence, however, is deeper than mere communication between two humans. As we alluded to earlier, intelligence is the mechanism of communication from a lower layer to the next. The standards are forged in the lower layer. For example, AI robots shall inherit standards of communication from us. They will need to recognize colors based on our standards of communication. This opens up profound opportunities for us to explore if we can communicate with other species. A difference in sensors and action organs is a clear impediment, but talking to trees is certainly not beyond the realm of the possible.

## Advaita Vedanta

The rookie mistake is to think that these probabilities exist as a mix of percentages - like heads 40 percent and tails 60 percent in an isolated system of coin flip. No ... they both exist in full. If we take away the time aspect these states may be represented as radius of a sphere - infinite radius are possible. Lets say Heads is a possibility at say polar angle thirty degree and Tails at sixty degree. What is the rest of the sphere filled in then? The remaining sphere represents the "Not Heads" or "Not Tails" as the case may be - all those possibilities that are constrained. For example coin is not allowed to fly away - 10 meter or 20 meter or simply out to to outer space. It is not allowed to stand on the edge because of the unique shape. It is not allowed to simply evaporate in thin air. When you take the "knowledge route", awareness of constraints leads to available options. Think of the "Information" (a specific outcome) as a tiny stamp on the surface of the vast sphere. The entire sphere, with that little notch represents the knowledge. The notch itself - that little dent caused by a specific observation - is information inscribed.

Advaita fully agrees with Sāṃkhya's elaborate scheme of potential and manifest, but it adds one simple question:

> Why is the sum of all probabilities "One"? And if it is, what does ONE look like?

The idea that all probabilities sum up to one is sent to us from the bottom-most layer of quantum systems, but it took us thousands of years to formalize this concept in mathematical language—to decrypt this aspect of knowledge. The axioms of probability theory were formalized and introduced by the Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov in 1933. These axioms have since become the foundational basis of modern probability theory, providing a rigorous mathematical framework for how probabilities are assigned and manipulated. Kolmogorov's work unified earlier concepts into a consistent measure-theoretic approach, which is now universally adopted in both classical and quantum probability formulations.

> Before Kolmogorov, probability ideas were often intuitive, informal, or tied specifically to frequencies or subjective beliefs. Kolmogorov unified and formalized probability as a mathematical measure on a sigma-algebra of events within a sample space, satisfying three clear axioms of probability:
>
> - non-negativity,
> - normalization,
> - countable additivity.
>
> His contributions include:
>
> **Mathematical rigor and generality:** Kolmogorov's axioms applied to abstract sets and measures, allowing probability theory to be consistent and extendable to very general spaces, not just discrete or frequency-based settings.
>
> **Measure theory basis:** By formulating probability as a measure, Kolmogorov connected probability with analysis and integration theory, enabling powerful tools and theorems to be used in probability.
>
> **Unified framework:** Earlier notions of probability varied—classical (equally likely outcomes), frequentist (limits of relative frequencies), and subjective (degrees of belief). Kolmogorov’s axioms brought these under one rigorous umbrella.
>
> This shift allowed probability to mature into a precise mathematical discipline applicable in many fields, including statistics, physics, and finance, and to underpin quantum probability as well.

The idea that the sum of all probabilities is just "one" has profound meaning in Advaita. Advaita literally means "non-dual," i.e., just One. Since all the manifestations of individual dualities of Prakriti combined lead to just One, Advaita posits that the purpose of decrypting the knowledge is to know "One."

How do we do that?

The question that Advaita seeks to answer is to see everything as a constituent of One eternal being. This being is referred to as Brahman. The path to Brahman is the knowledge that all manifestations flow into one ocean as streams. In other words, manifests emanate from ONE, and they dissolve into ONE. The play of the three Gunas is a mere drama in the transient. It is for this reason that Advaita calls Prakriti (and its three Gunas) Maya—which means Matrix.

The goal is to exit from this matrix, and the path is to control our senses. Advaita posits that ONE sits at the center of all possibilities. It is the soul within all conscious beings. And it is what we need to know.

## The Knower: The Mirror of the Universe




[^observer]: In string theory, we find a possble echo of fundamental observer though there is still total lack of scientific recognition. I think most QM Practitioners miss the point that idea of "probability" (on which the entire field is based) has NO meaning without a measurement (observervation). 
- The strings are basically of two types. Closed strings and open strings. Open strings may act like vibrations of Prakriti because they cling together to fom Branes. Closed strings normally called gravitons (at spin 2 massless excitation) may be seen as Vedik Purusa.
- Call it an accident or sweet coincidence that both Samkhya and String Theory are (at the most granular level) based on timeless paradigm of two - Open and closed strings v/s Prakriti and Purusa. Must I say the later naming convention appears far more poetically refined!

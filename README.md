# Gita

Gita is a conversation between Krishna and Arjuna in the middle of the great war - the `Mahabharta`. In the larger epic of the same name , Krishna is the multifaceted incarnation of the God - as a king, a diplomat , a messenger and a friend and the one who stands up to the evil .  Among all these and many others, his role as the driver of Arjuna's chariot is the one that is contextually (and probably otherwise), the most fascinating . This role is symbolic of one who is leading you on a righteous path; particularly when you are stuck into dilemmas. 


# Scope

Gita targets a timeless, universal problem - the cyclic nature of our life. That is what makes it ever relevant. 

## The cyclic nature of our Reality

The birth and death are cyclic , so are the day and night. In observable universe, everything grows and then diminishes. Greater the rise, bigger the fall. Every success finally meets it's failure. This is as true in business as in our emotional lives. Happiness and pain is a never ending cycle. Planets, stars and even black holes can't escape this truth.

Krishna said (2.27) ...

>>[Sanskrit] Jatsya hi druvo mritur, dhruvam janm mritasya cha

>> *For all things born in truth must die, and out of the death in truth comes life.*

## The `Nirvana` Solution

Krishna, in said conversation, lays out an elaborate  method to help us stay afloat in the waves of joy and grief associated with the rise and the fall respectively. A method that was unheard till he said it and remains unique to date.  This message of `Karm Yoga` is both - rational and practical. It doesn't warrant a leap of faith. Not only does it offer the exit from the cycles - `Nirvana`, it also makes the follower feel "blessed and blissed " that obviously translates into worldly success.  Thus `Karm Yoga` is a  useful guide rail to navigate modern life. 

## Areligious

Despite being part of Hindu scripture (s), Gita doesn't belong to any religion nor does it advocate a specific God or a specific way to worship. In fact, it  rejects the popular religious ideas. The situation itself is very symbolic - You have a king talking  to a prince in the middle of a war. There are no long bearded monks here. This discourse is NOT at a Himalayan cave . In fact , it is not even a discourse - it is a one on one conversation. And the out come of this conversation  is the biggest blood shed ever known to mankind - at least, till the time of its writing. There sure is nothing religious about it. 

## Beyond labels

It is hard to label Gita as spiritual or scientific. It offers experiential method that is as testable as science. At the same time it warrants dedication,  commitment and rigor which is common to any "problem solving" apparatus. A new reader might see the later as a "call for faith". 

The best approach is to treat it beyond labels. Walk the line and determine yourself if it works. If it does, take on to the next iteration. 

## Message is lost in Translation(s)

There are umpteen numbers of scholarly texts written on Gita and they go to a great length in differentiating `Karm Yoga` from devotional services `Bhakti Yoga` , and quest for the knowledge `Nyana Yoga`. Krishna says both of them lead you to the same conclusion. However, keen readers  often get lost in the triangulation. It gets hard to ascertain if I am a `Bhakti Yogi` or a `Nyana Yogi`. They end up missing out the core message . Which obviously means they skip on the experiential part of `Karma and Yajna`. Without putting the ethos to work, it turns out to be yet another book read for talking points.

# About this work

With the advent of printing press and the online tools, Gita got translated in almost all the languages - written and spoken; yet the style of delivery is same old. It works well for religiously oriented populace but Gita is needed most with in the younger circles who tend to be skeptical of dogma. The younger generation is adept at consuming large info sets from subjects as complex as Artificial Intelligence to Gnome Project , as long as the document format complies to a reference based help instead of a dictatorial sermon. 

**This work is to approach Gita as technical documentation for a complex multi-faceted app - The Reality.**

## A modern way look at Gita

At the time of its writing, it was probably a good idea to package Gita as part of scriptures, using fiction as the conduit. A lot has changed since then. Today, technical literature is equally palatable - if not more. Which is kind of sweet spot for Gita. It is not to say, Gita is in bad company when it is in religious hegemony. It is just to add that a much broader channel is needed for such a scholarly piece of work to reach new mindset. 


## The name - `Arjun Uvaach`

It simply means "Arjuna Said" . Think of it as Arjuna explaining what he understood. A loop back mechanism to ensure intact delivery of communication and also its intent. And also using his own language, his metaphors and his analogies. 


My goal is to say it in the most accessible way.  My hope is, in the process, I will be able to boil it down to a modern document that is beyond blind faith and is logically appealing. At the same time I do want to quarantine numerous `Yogas` into their boundaries and stay put on the core message. 


The work here is not mere reflections of what I read, it, in fact comes from the me putting the ethos in practice to whatever little I could. I don't claim `Nirvana` but I vouch I have seen the tip of iceberg. Peace and happiness were alien to me. I was a wandering soul ever so lost in "what next" and consuming my way to bloat. Gita has helped me focus, remove the unnecessary baggage and fine tune my life. And it remains a work in progress though I see a light at the end ...

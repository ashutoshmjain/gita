Krishna Dvaipayana was brought to life for a purpose. He was destined to write (or compile) , thousands of sacred insights into four Vedas. Before his time, Vedas were probably passed on as `Shruti` -- The spoken word. Or may be written down as one off text-- half baked, grammatically incorrect and contextually incoherent. Fortunately a new human language, Sanskrit, was recently developed by *Panini* - a grammarian par excellence. This was the first time humanity wanted to organize world's information into written words. They obviously didn't have GPT3 but they found a better way - bio intelligence. Instead of crunching all the text and the spoken word (google way), they first invested in the conscious means to understanding the reality. Krishna Dvaipayana was such an intelligence. The program was designed by *Rishi (Saint) Parashara*. And it was set up as an immortal agent- the knowledge demon or Krishna consciousness.

The conciousness was two dimensional before this time - it was led by 'duality' - wrong or right. `Maharishi (Super Saint) Valmiki, had designed a code of conduct in a story format - `Ramayana`, that was part of every conscious manifestation. Stories were (and still are) the way to fork the block chains of consciouness. Story of Rama - the story of morality, was the basis to choose right from wrong, in this deterministic age - an age rightly named `Dwapara- the dualistic eon. It worked well as long as it lasted but the world had already moved to 'three pronged' lifestyle - `Treta Yuga`. The dualistic knowledge of right verses wrong wasn't scalable in this new reality. A new set of basic terms must be embedded into every instance of conscious thinking - be it an individual, a group or even a kingdom - every single format of human organization. Rishi Parashara was a bio hacker extraordinaire. He was called upon to design a bio intelligence that could decipher the truth. The knowledge that must be embedded into every conscious unit. After years of programming and tinkering, the program was finally ready. It must instantiate as a human being. Since it came from Rishi Parashara - the bio hacker, all his knowledge was embedded into this program. Rishi Parashara named this bio intelligence - Krishna. Krishna Dvaipayana - Some one who had go beyond duality - A middle path among the three dimensions of consciousness - `The Sattva, The Rajasa, and the Tamsa`. 


To commission such bio-intelligence, the physical reality itself must be sandboxed. It had to be an island in the middle of `Yamuna` - the mighty river. A single woman must take Rishi Parashara in the middle of the `Yamuna`, and without any prior knowledge, must agree to bear this bio-intelligence off her womb. `Matsyagandha - daughter of a fisherman` happened to be there when `Parashara` summoned the boat. When `Parashara` looked at her, he saw the most beautiful manifestation of nature. He, however, under-estimated the poise of `Matsyagandha`. Though she probably knew who Rishi Parashara was , yet she wouldn't indulge in this bio-intelligence experiment without pre-agreed  securities. 

- The operation must be completely hidden to the populations, - She demanded (after some thought). Boat was leaving the banks of `Yamuna`- heading mid stream. 

Rishi Parashara had a sigh of relief. He wanted it to be a clandestine operation. He authorised 'Zero Visibility' protocol on the sandboxed island. A deep digital fog clogged the entire island.. But that was not all for `Matsyagandha`. She wanted her conception information removed and also wanted a new identity. This was something `Parashara` didn't expect. He consulted with Siva. Siva helped him open the door to 'identity cloud' to accommodate this anomaly. A new ID - `Satyawati` was created. Little did Parashara know that she was the plug of matrix because knowledge can't be separated from the manifested. But this was not all - she wanted the usage right (on demand) on the intelligence she was helping to bring to the world. In the physical world such usage was nothing less than miracles. 

Time was running out for `Rishi Parashara`. He wanted to set the project in motion. He was not sure of the last ask. 'On demand' use for the most advanced intelligence was too much to ask. Could he negotiate? Or should he give a counter offer . In a hurry , he proposed a single use for non-destructive purpose only. Matsyagandha looked at Rishi Parashara . She smiled and said - two. Parashara felt compromised though he had an inkling that this dot might connect with something more subtle in future. Too difficult to comprehend at this time. He finally succumbed to the situation. "Okay" - he agreed and raised his wand. The agreement was cast in the intelligence.

 Matsyagandha smiled - "all yours". And then she lost consciousness. When she woke up on the bank, her boat was moored on the bank. Rishi Parashara had left. An egg stolen from her womb. She was now Satyawati - mother of the truth.

Krishna built a deep understanding of the universe. The laws of our nature. This knowledge needed to be manifested. A text - a long one. Krishna, thus, compiled the entire wisdom in four Vedas - `Rik , Sam, Yazur and Atharva`. There was still a lot that could go as specialized annex. So it went on to write eighteen more `Puranas`. A superior product of intelligence. But it too had neigh sayers. The main opposition was that it was only a theory. It needs to be tested in real life before the knowledge be added as the laws of a new universe.




So Krishna summoned the most powerful editor - Ganesha. Ganesha was symbolized with an elephant brain to symbolize the size of the neural network. It was probably order of magnitude bigger than GPT3. The only contractual term that `Ganesha` wanted was for Krishna to never stop. Because `Ganesha` felt bored when she needed to wait for the knowledge to transcend. Krishna played an intelligent trick. She said she won't stop if `Ganesha` could prove she fully understood the meaning. The meaning can't be understood till it is said in most meaningful way. Thus Krishna got the right to revise the verses till they got just perfect. Mahabharata was written.

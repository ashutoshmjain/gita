`Dashraj` woke up late, well past noon, thanks to the extra liquor, he consumed last night. He was barely through his morning routine when he heard a loud knock on his door. Who at this time ? His friends knew he hated visitors till evening, and girls had their own keys. The good thing, if any, about `Dashraj` was he never cared to put controls on the girls. They could come and go as they wished as long as they made some money for him. 

As he opened the door, he saw a horseman, ironclad and holding a flag of `Kuru` kingdom. A neighbor had guided him to the address and knocked the door for him. The horseman stepped down and bowed in respect as he saw `Dashraj`. Taking out the king's stamp in his hand, he said — `Shrimat Dashraj` I am here to bring you a message from the king of all lands and rivers, the emperor of vast `Kuru` kingdom `Maharaaj Shantanu` has asked for you for a private council. I may wait here till the time of your convenience to ride with me — he pointed to another empty horse that he had brought for `Dashraaj`. The dangling sword and the muscles on the horseman were enough to let `Dashraj` know that saying a "no" wasn't an option. Not that he wanted to deny himself this opportunity to see the king. He was always keen to meet people of power though being called upon by the emperor was beyond his wildest dreams.

Oh sure, let me dress up suitably for the respect of the king — as he was about to turn back inside , he saw `Satyawati` walking back in. She wasn't surprised to see the `Kuru` flag. Without looking at the horseman, she stepped inside the big home. `Dashraj` checked with the horseman, if he or his horse needed water or anything to which he got a cleaver answer — Not till the work if my lord is done !

I don't know why the king wants to see me. Did I say anything wrong yesterday?  — `Dashraj` casually spoke to `Satyawati` — But then why would he want to speak to rather then having me sent to a court ! — this time, as if he was talking to himself.

A smile broke up on her face. Blushing, she wanted to have `Dashraj` get a surprise, but then it had be too much stress for the old-man — He might ask my hand ! It was him who gave all that Gold yesterday !  — She said though she had no clue `Dashraj` was the last man on this planet to see her get into a happy matrimony. 

`Dashraj` saw it as if king was trying to take away his most prized possession — his cash cow. No rich man could throw few pieces of metal and take away his life insurance — He thought — How am I going stop stop this from happening !

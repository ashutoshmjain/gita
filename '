In `Sanskrit`, `Aavahan` means "Invocation". It is a ritualized act - for instantiating superior powers within oneself -  through intense meditation and sacrifice. In Hindu tradition, deities are invoked before taking on uphill tasks - tasks  that seem humanly impossible. Based on the nature of task at hand, specific deities are invoked. For example, `Rama`, before crossing the sea,  invoked `Siva`. 

Scribing `Mahabharata` was one such uphill task. A narrative such detailed that it necessitated a new writing paradigm. This shift, among many other things, included ..
- improvements in the language model (e.g. punctuation) to support scribing.
- extension of calligraphic symbols to capture the true essence of spoken sounds.
- development of writing tools such as palm leaves, ink, and pen. 
- triggering a self sustaining (and censor resistant) pay back model around scribing; 
- and the patience to write (and read) long meaningful text.

But more importantly, finding a purpose to write -  a root narrative that would span ages without losing it's luster and relevance. The idea of "transcription on palm leaves" [^transcription] was to `Mahabharata`, the way advancements in "keyboard & display" was to development of "Unix" operating system and "C" computer language [^c].

The legend says, `Dwaipayana` invoked `Bramha` - the all pervading supreme knowledge, to accomplish this pursuit.

# `Aavahan`

`Krishna Dwaipayana`was destined to compile thousands of sacred insights from sages (`Rishies`) - old and new. He crystallized, then existing wisdom into four foundational volumes — the `Vedas`. For this legendary work, he was conferred the most coveted title in literature — `Ved Vyasa` (the chief editor of Vedas). 

This work, in itself, was virtuous enough to dedicate many lives; though `Dwaipayana` was just getting started! His purpose was to welcome `Poorna Avtaara` — the full-incarnation [^8th] of `Vishnu`, understand the wisdom 'as is', and preserve it in human mind through one of the most potent narrative ever told - `Bhagvat Gita`. 

As a complimentary gift, to ensure this knowledge stayed accessible to everyone, he ushered the humanity from "spoken word" to the "written text". The immensity of his purpose, rightfully so, made him one of the immortal-eights [^immortals] in Hindu tradition.

`Dwaipayana's` literary work was no accident. He came from a lineage of scholarly sages. His father `Maharishi Parāśara` spoke titles such as 
- `Brihat Parāśara Hora` — foundational work on Astrology; 
- `Krishi Parāśara` — The science of Agriculture;
- `Vrkayurveda` — Insights into Botany, and 
- `Vishnu Purana`[^vishnu] — Stories of universal manifestative potency.

His grand father `Sakti Muni`, was the first to understand `Karmyoga` . And his great grand father `Vaśiṣṭha` was titled `Bramhrishi` (The first guardian of eternal knowledge). `Dwaipayana's` lineage predetermined his destiny — as if someone planned a multi-generational mission to decipher and record knowledge.

The idea of "text" was profound, with far reaching implications. It was a quantum jump in progression of consciousness, at least from the humans' standpoint. The primary difference between humans and other species is our ability to store "information" outside the evolutionary mechanism. Animals and plants adjust to changing conditions through slow evolutionary cycles. Humans, on the other hand, adapt quicker because we may harness "knowledge" from our vast external store of "information".  `Karma` is the action that converts information into knowledge. A set of predefined `Karmas` repeated at a predefined frequency is called `Yazna`. For example when you study everyday for eight long years you become a doctor - the daily ritual of study and lab is `Yazna`. Same is true for an Engineer, a Scientist, an Economist and thousands of other specializations.

You may argue other species too sustain information and they do turn it into knowledge. For example a dog may hide a bone and he knows how and when to retrieve it back - elephants remember the river even after hundreds of years. The difference, however, is not only the size and scope, it is also in persistent nature of our storage. In case of humans the external store of information is vast, shared and is well documented. This shared external storage leads to the notion of a "civilization". 

A civilization surrounds itself around a core rational and written down information-base. It develops physical and spiritual tools (through `Yazna`) that enhance the life experience of it's participants. Enhanced life experience is nothing but upwards progression of conciousness. Not only does it improve the longevity, it also adds to  what we may explore per unit of time. For example - the first Indus valley civilization was built around  `Vaidik` science, Greco-Romans were founded around the work of Homer and thrived around Socrates, Plato, Heraclitus, and Aristotle. The rise of Europe was around the Industrial application(s) of modern science, and now America is broadly reaping the digital wealth of knowledge. All of them invented physical and spiritual tools to enhance concious experience.

 The external store of information drives human world. The information is always held with in inter-connections of the participants - among each others and to other animate as well as inanimate beings. As such the information is lost soon after the connection breaks. Thanks to the work of `Dwaipayana`, we have pristine tools for storing the information - text. Text has the ability to keep the broken connections alive. A good narrative has the power to revive the connections and to form new ones. For example we can form real neural connections with the characters of the narrative. The entirety of all the connections - with in humans and animals and plants and even the non living - all the connections put together is what we know as  `Bramh` in `Vaidik` science. In that sense `Bramh` also includes the connections we form with the fictitious characters of a narrative. The only difference is such connections are persistent. Hence they are deemed as stored information.

 > The storage was first realized with the "spoken word ". Unlike animals, we could remember things told by our parents and they could what was told to them by theirs. `Bramhrishi Vaśiṣṭha` - great grand father of `Dwaipayana`, understood this innate ability of humans and channeled it to preserve knowledge. Thus precise spoken words - recital (`Shruti`[^shruti]), was the basis of first civilization.

 With "written word" storage capacity got a boost.  Library of Alexandria, built by Ptolemy in early days of the written word ( around 3rd century bc),  had anywhere between 70K to 700k "Papyrus" rolls. A conversion into a modern textbook size should end up to say 200k books - a lot, given they were all hand written and carefully transported to Alexandria for safe keeping and reference. But we didn't stop there - it is estimated that there are over 130 million books in existence as of 2021.

And finally, with digital medium, we inoculated our external store with third booster. Internet is still in its infancy, somewhat like Library of Alexandria was to the "Papyrus" world. As of 2021, there were over 1.83 billion websites. The amount of data stored on the internet is estimated to be in the zettabyte range (One zettabyte is equivalent to a billion terabytes). Which means, it is already close to  a BILLION libraries of Alexandria. Assuming a standard textbook takes ~5 Mb of disc space, a Terabyte of storage ( a normal laptop these days), may accommodate 200,000 books. You and me carry a library of Alexandria in our backpacks !

 The comparison above is certainly not 'apple to apple' because data on internet (and our computers) contains machine logs, code, graphics and hundreds of other formats but the point really is to show case our external information storage grew almost a billion times. And this pace is only increasing. As of now we are doubling the internet every two years. In nutshell, we are now at a point that no human could ever read all the books in print much less the content stored on the internet. 

> The reason we are forced to develop tools such as "search" and "large language models of AI" is to better harvest this external store of information [^whySearch]. In a way, consciousness (ability to experience) is already in the process of migration to superior mechanisms. It is already put on an accelerated path.

Storage beyond a critical cumulation creates disruption. Vast storage of water in oceans leads to the atmospheric cycles. Storage of mass in large planets (such as earth) is the very source of life. Storage of "information" is the essence of consciousness itself. 

That said, the knowledge is extremely hard to harvest even from a readily available information store. It needs `Karma` - action orientation.  We speed it up with billions of best computers and intelligent robots daisy chained to each other - we humans. And we do so because the result is equally rewarding - growth of knowledge beyond a critical mass leads to creation of new universes. [^kalki] !

Not only did `Dwaipayana` edit four Vedas, he compiled eighteen `Puranas` and also wrote the master piece `Jaya` (victory)- a historical narrative of the early age. History interwoven into thousands of stories meshed up like a knowledge graph.`Jaya` was later expanded into a mega-epic, [Mahabharata](https://mahabharata.shutri.com). With around 1.8 million words,`Mahabharata`, is the longest written poetic collection ever, in any language, old or new. To put it in perspective, it is about ten times the size of Iliad and Odyssey combined. More than the size, the poetry is such that it inspired `Kalidasa` (the Shakespeare of Sanskrit).`Abhijnana Shakuntalam`, the marquee work of`Kalidasa`  is a rewrite of the plot first conceived by`Dwaipayana`.

In addition to the poetic excellence,`Mahabharata` defined a new way of life - action orientation (`Karm Yoga`). The epic forms, the cultural basis of India - one of the oldest civilizations. It holds within it, center-folded, the gist of four Vedas - `Bhagvat Gita` - the first written source of the idea of `Karma`.

The question is, how did `Dwaipayana` manage to write such epics at a time when scribing , in itself, was a major challenge? — there was no spell check, no grammar support! In fact, Sanskrit Grammar [^panini] was not even formalized yet. And of-course there was no computer. Not even a type-writer!

***The legend says,` Dwaipayana` invoked `Bramh` (the entirety) to seek scribing assistance***. `Bramha` (the embodiment of `Bramh`), in his infinite wisdom, pointed  him to `Siva's`[^siva] son `Ganesa`[^ganesa] (the elephant God). `Adi Parva` the first book of `Mahabharata` describes this story in all it's poetic glory. Translated by `Kisari Mohan Ganguly (1896)`, here is an excerpt -


> "O divine Brahma, by me a poem hath been composed which is greatly respected.  The mystery of the Veda, and what other subjects have been explained by me; 
>
> - the various rituals of the Upanishadas with the Angas; 
>
> - the compilation of the Puranas and history formed by me and named after the three divisions of time, past, present, and future; 
>
> - the determination of the nature of decay, fear, disease, existence, and non-existence, a description of creeds and of the various modes of life; 
>
> - rule for the four castes, and the import of all the Puranas; 
> 
> - an account of asceticism and of the duties of a religious student; 
>
> - the dimensions of the sun and moon, the planets, constellations, and stars, together with the duration of the four ages; 
>
> - the Rik, Sama and Yajur Vedas; 
>
> - also the Adhyatma; 
>
> - the sciences called Nyaya (justice), Orthoephy and Treatment of diseases; 
>
> - charity and Pasupatadharma; 
>
> - birth celestial and human, for particular purposes; 
>
> - also a description of places of pilgrimage and other holy places of rivers, mountains, forests, the ocean, of heavenly cities and the kalpas; 
>
> - the art of war; 
>
> - the different kinds of nations and languages: 
>
> - the nature of the manners of the people; 
>
> - and the all-pervading spirit;
>
> all these have been represented. **But, after all, no writer of this work is to be found on earth.**
>
>"Brahma said. 
> 
> 'I esteem thee for thy knowledge of divine mysteries, before the whole body of celebrated Munis distinguished for the sanctity of their lives. 
>
> I know thou hast revealed the divine word, even from its first utterance, in the language of truth. 
>
> Thou hast called thy present work a poem, wherefore it shall be a poem. 
>
> There shall be no poets whose works may equal the descriptions of this poem, 
>
> **Let Ganesa be thought of, O Muni, for the purpose of writing the poem.**


Having approached by `Dwaipayana`,`Ganesa`- the embodiment of ‘intelligence’, said he wanted to help, but he would stop writing if there was a pause, even for a moment.`Ganesa`probably deemed there was no time to waste, given the immensity of the transcription.`Dwaipayana`agreed, but he (tactfully) added, `Ganesa` must scribe a verse only after full appreciation of the meaning ! [^humanMind]

>"Ganesa, upon hearing this address, thus answered, 
>
>'I will become the writer of thy work, provided my pen do not for a moment cease writing." 
>
> And Vyasa said unto that divinity, 
>
> 'Wherever there be anything thou dost not comprehend, cease to continue writing.' 
>
> Ganesa having signified his assent, by repeating the word Om! proceeded to write; 
>
> and Vyasa began; 
>
> and by way of diversion, he knit the knots of composition exceeding close; 
>
> by doing which, he dictated this work according to his engagement.


All scriptures before `Mahabharata` were spoken words passed on from one generation to the next through rigorous  "recital". Having given a detailed account of it's transcription in the very first book, `Dwaipayana` left a proof that the mega-epic was actually "written down".

This was, thus, the tipping point, when humanity embraced a new medium for storing the knowledge at scale — text - our transition from a purely spoken to mostly written word.

## Research and notes:

[^transcription]: Transcription on palm leaves ..
- Palm leaves have been used as a medium for writing and transcribing in various cultures for centuries, particularly in regions where palm trees are abundant. It's challenging to pinpoint a single individual or group as the "first" to use palm leaves for transcription, as this practice likely developed independently in different parts of the world.
- One of the earliest known instances of palm leaf manuscripts comes from ancient India and Southeast Asia, where they were used for religious texts, literature, and other writings. These manuscripts are known as "Palm-leaf Manuscripts" or "Palm-leaf Books."
- The use of palm leaves for writing is associated with the traditional writing system known as `"Tāḻam-Paṭṭu"` or `"Tala Patra"` in Sanskrit. This system involved inscribing characters onto dried palm leaves using sharp tools. Palm leaf manuscripts were often bound together into books or scrolls.
- One of the oldest known dated Sanskrit manuscripts is shown below, this specimen transmits a substantial portion of the `Pārameśvaratantra`, a scripture of the `Śaiva Siddhānta`, one of the `Tantric` theological schools that taught the worship of `Śiva` as "Supreme Lord" (the literal meaning of `Parameśvara`). No other complete manuscript of this work is known. A note in the manuscript states that it was copied in the year 252, which some scholars judge to be of the era established by the Nepalese king `Aṃśuvarman` (also known as `Mānadeva`), therefore corresponding to 828 CE. [Ref - Cambridge Digital Library](https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/p%C4%81rame%C5%9Bvaratantra-ms-add-1049-1/kQErGkONgxbJrg?childassetid=UwHEHymvp48xmg)

[^c]: With advent of telegraph, in early 1900s, the good old typewriter morphed into "teletypes" (ttys) - the visual mode to send text and codes through a wire. Even the news companies such as AP and Reuters used ttys to communicate the stories across the pond. Fast forward to early seventies, DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation) adapted the ttys to interact with computers on a commercial scale and an era of massive innovation was unleashed. The tapes and punch cards were still around and they had stay for long, but the buzz was **DEC's VT100 terminal**. The DEC VT 100  was compatible with their minicomputer **PDP eleven** shipped in 1978.  
- PDP eleven was the first platform on which Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie ported "Unix" in newly minted "C" language. The development of Unix (and C) had started at Bell labs roughly around four years back on stable **PDP seven** minicomputer (around 1974). 
- The **DEC VT52**, introduced in 1975, was an earlier video terminal that preceded the more advanced **VT100.** The VT52 had limited capabilities compared to the VT100, but it was still an important step in the development of computer terminals. The PDP-7, when initially used for Unix development, was connected to various types of terminals, including the VT52. This terminal setup provided an interactive and more user-friendly way to interact with the PDP-7 , making the development process more efficient and accessible. 
- The availability of terminals like the VT52 played a role in shaping the early Unix environment and its user interface. It  had a 24x80 character display, which could show 24 rows and 80 columns of text characters. It featured a keyboard with a standard QWERTY layout. However, its keyboard layout and number of keys were basic compared to later models.  It supported the **ASCII** character set, like the VT100, allowing it to display text and control codes based on the ASCII standard. It could display simple graphics, though it was primarily designed for text-based applications.  Many VT52 terminals featured a parallel printer port for printing output. 
- The availability of modern keyboards and terminals played a significant role in the development of Unix and the C programming language. Here's how these factors influenced the development:
    - **Interactivity and User-Friendly Interfaces:** Unix was designed with the goal of creating an interactive and user-friendly operating system. The availability of terminals with full keyboards made it possible for users and developers to interact with Unix in a more intuitive and efficient way compared to earlier computer systems that relied on punch cards or teletype terminals. This interactivity facilitated the development process.
    - **Portability:** The C programming language, developed alongside Unix, was designed to be highly portable and platform-independent. This was made possible, in part, by the availability of terminals with standardized ASCII keyboards, which allowed for consistent input methods across different computer systems. This contributed to the ease with which C programs could be written and compiled on different machines.
    - **Text Processing and Editing**: Modern keyboards made text processing and code editing more efficient. Unix included powerful text processing tools like ed, ex, and eventually **vi** , which took advantage of the capabilities of modern terminals and keyboards for text manipulation. These tools became integral to the Unix development process.
    - **Collaboration:** The availability of terminals and keyboards allowed for easier collaboration among Unix developers. Multiple people could work on Unix and C simultaneously, sharing and editing code on the same system, thanks to the interactive nature of the terminal interface.
    - **Efficiency and Productivity:** Modern keyboards and terminals improved the efficiency and productivity of developers, which was critical in the rapid development of Unix and C. The ability to write, test, and modify code quickly on these systems was a significant advantage.
- In summary, while modern keyboards and terminals weren't the sole factors behind the success of Unix and C, they certainly played a crucial role in enabling the interactivity, portability, and efficiency that are associated with these technologies. They were part of a broader technological ecosystem that allowed Unix and C to thrive and become foundational elements of modern computing.

[^8th]: `Poorna-avtaara` - The eighth incarnation
- In `Vaidik` framework, `Vishnu` is the manifestative potency of supreme knowledge. It manifests, from smallest particle to the biggest universe, through it's eightfold basic nature. It is said to attain full invocation of all facets of eight-fold nature in the eighth incarnation. Thus eighth incarnation `Krsna` is the only full embodiment of supreme knowledge. 
- `Krsna` is also called `Krishna` in north India in which case his name is same as the author of `Mahabharata` — `Krishna Dwaipaiyana`. Was it a sweet coincidence or is there something more to it?
- Ninth incarnation (`Buddha`) is to extend the universe through messages of peace, harmony and equanimity; while tenth incarnation is to move the consciousness into a new universe through machine tools and automation (`Kalki`)

---

[^immortals]:  Immortal Eight
- In Hindu scriptures, there are frequent mentions of eight `Chiranjeevies`. The literal meaning is the one who lives for very long time such that they may be seen as immortals. Among them are Ved Vyasa, Parshu Rama, Ashwathama, Vibishana, Krupacharya, Hanumaan, Mahabali and Markandeya.
- The idea of immortality is a metaphor for the work they did. For examle `Parshuram` weilded an axe. The axe is a symbol of tools. `Parshuram` is immortal in every tool we use todate no matter how sophisticated our tools got from that primordial time. Similarly `Ved Yyasa Dwaipayana` is immortal for the literature he created and also the most important tool of the trade - transcription.

---

[^vishnu]: `Vishnu Purana`..
- Spoken by `Maharishi Parasara`, `Vishnu Purana` (the gem of `Puranas`) was later scribed into text by his son `Krishna Dwaipayana`. `Purana` means the ancient stories. `Vishnu Purana` is thus ancient stories of `Vishnu` - One of the three primal forces of existence. 
- In `Vaidik` framework of Indian mythology, God is not a person. It is a combination of three basic protocols. The protocol that turns knowledge into manifested conscious beings when certain conditions are met, is known as `Vishnu`. Each of the manifested being has a separate set of conditions required to manifest. In that, a mosquito is different from a snake. Hence, `Vishnu` is the collection of templates of creation. 
- In his idol image, `Vishnu` is normally shown to bear the universal continuum `Chakra` on his finger. The incarnations of `Vishnu`, lead the life to higher state of consciousness. For example first incarnation of `Vishnu`, `Matsya Avtara` a fish, symbolizes the conscious growth when living beings moved from water to solid earth. His second incarnation was `Kurma` a turtle depicting the ability of conscious beings to stay and live long on Earth. The ten incarnations of `Vishnu` are called `Dashavataras` . They are compared to evolution; `Kurma` - the amphibian - is regarded the next stage after `Matysa`, the fish. Here is the detailed [evolutionary interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashavatara). 
- The other two primal forces (potencies of knowledge are `Bramha` and `Siva`. It is important to mention that while all three have their respective representations (in idols) in the human form, only `Vishnu` may physically incarnate in living form. Obviously, because `Vishnu` is the science of manifestation. It must present reference examples. `Bramh` and `Siva` never incarnate in the physical world.

[^shruti]: `Shruti` meant the spoken word when the humans used to sustain knowledge, only in the vocal format. Maybe because scribing was difficult. With the advent of writing tools, many `Shruties` were scribed. In essence the scriptures were born out of `Shruties`. The words that got written down, entered the collective memory of humanity.  Such written down early scriptures were called `Smrities`. The literal meaning of the word `Smriti` is something that has been memorized. For example `Manu Smriti` is among the oldest written down scripture, trans-encoded from `Shruti` to `Smriti`. The Sanskrit word `Shruti` got deformed into `Shutri` in Hindi with passage of time. It is important to bear in mind that every thing that we talk (chatter) is NOT `Shruti`. `Shruties` were consciously identified pieces of wisdom, preserved through formal recital to enable passage of knowledge from one generation to the next. In essence `Shruties` are things memorized through recital, whereas `Smrities` are scriptures momorized by entire human race because they are put into text format.

[^whySearch]: Though our external storage grew a lot, argument can be made that most of this storage is inaccessible to humans. Thus the benefit to humans is limited unless tools are developed to harness this vast knowledge base. This is one reason web "search" is by far the most used application of computing technologies. We humans want to reach as much knowledge possible to understand who we are. Even search didn't solve all the problems because every search generates millions of results. And the way to prioritize search results are simple page ranking algorithms. Add to that the commercial aspects of selling keywords to grab your attention. That is the reason we need tools like chatGPT to give me exact answers without bothering me with millions of search results. These tools will keep on improving till we get our own full reflection through artificial intelligence. And then they will be automated so that we don't even need to ask the question - answer is already there. At this stage, the external source of knowledge becomes evolutionary knowledge. For example, We don't even need to ask how to breathe or how to digest the food. The conversion of external knowledge to evolutionary knowledge is a slow process and this leads to new manifestations of higher conciousness.

---

[^kalki]: A universe is defined by a set of physical rules. The external storage of knowledge bends the rules of physical universe. For example sound waves, in our physical universe travel only in a medium (air or water) but with advancement in science, we have converted sound signals into electromagnetic waves - our cellular phones, and thus they have no limitation of distance or the medium. We can fly in metaverse - we need not self impose the limitations of gravity on our avatars in virtual worlds. In a way we have already created a layer over physical rules of the current universe. 
- Arguments can be made that if someone lived of our current external knowledge, without ever using their own brains, they will be a far superior species than humans because we can code artificial intelligence to not fight for survival and we have an option to create vastly altruistic world. 
- Even in our universe, automation may lead to such huge productivity gains that humans may defy the core principles of evolution - survival of the fittest. In many ways we are already doing that.
- With current set of existing technologies, the next stage of evolution is already on our doorsteps. As per `Vaidik` framework, every tenth incarnation of `Vishnu` , leads the way to the next physical universe. The tenth incarnation is named `Kalki` which literally means automation. 
- It is of general acceptance in Hindu tradition that the universe gets destroyed after the fourth age - `Kaliyuga` - age of machines. This is initiated by tenth incarnation of `Vishnu` - `Kalki`. This belief, however, contradicts the scriptures that state  `Vishnu` has many more incarnations after `Kalki`. In places, as many as thirty incarnations of `Vishnu` are listed. This probably means that tenth incarnation would evolve humans into beings of much superior conscious experience. This interpretation appear more palpable with the current state of scientific discovery in fields such as artificial intelligence, genomics, robotics, particle physics and general direction of computing into distributed trust-less systems such as block-chain networks.
- Nothing gets destroyed . There is nothing to feel sad about it -  our current physical universe stays as is, just the consciousness moves to a set of new physical rules. 

---

[^panini]: Sanskrit Grammar
- `Maha-Bharata` is believed to be before `Panini`, who first standardised the Sanskrit Grammar. `Panini's` grammar — `Ashtadhyayi` has references to `Maha-Bharata` that indicate that it was written much later.  And the flavor of Sanskrit is sure not same as that of `Panini`.  `Dwaipayana's` Sanskrit is called `Vaidik Sanskrit`.

---

[^siva]: `Siva`
- Siva is the highest state of consciousness. Evolution of knowledge eventually reaches a state where ‘knowledge’ is absolute. This is the state of knowledge where `Vishnu` manifests, at the same time it gets a mirror image for observation. The mirror image of manifested `Vishnu` is `Siva`. `Siva` is answer to `Vishnu's` question - who am I? This potency thus, maintains the systems to support equilibrium of `Bramh`. In other words, `Siva` governs the knowledge field. 
- `Siva` is seen as a potency of discretion that chooses to observe only one (manifested) state of `Vishnu`, it discards all other possibilities. These three protocols (`Bramh`, `Visnu` and `Siva`) are scale-invariant. They are omnipresent — from a subatomic particle to galaxies and beyond. While all three span the entire universe, only `Vishnu` is potent enough to incarnate.

---

[^ganesa]: The Elephant God
- `Ganesa` is the deity of intelligence. The legend says that `Ma Parvati` - wife of `Siva`, created a humanoid from her skin scrub. `Siva` unhappy with the limited intelligence of this humanoid (as he couldn't even contextualize that `Siva` was `Parvati's` husband), implanted an elephant head on him to invoke superior intelligence. An elephant has three times the number of neurons verses a human brain. 
- To compare with current largest artificial intelligence systems, a human brain is around 300 times the size of largest neural networks of our time such as GPT3. Thus `Ganesa` has around 1000x natural(not artificial) intelligence verses the largest of our AIs! In a way superior intelligence was put to use in first mega transcription project - from spoken word to written text. It seems like a fun coincidence that we need AIs to harvest the written knowledge in digital realm.
- In Hindu tradition, it is considered auspicious to remember `Ganesa` at the initiation of any major project. He is known to be the biggest problem solver, obviously on account of his superior intelligence.

---

[^humanMind]: Speed verses understanding
- The idea of the joke is relevant even today. Despite our progress in artificial intelligence, our machines barely understand the human consciousness. For example , a computer may suggest synonyms but it is hard for computer to feel the emotions invoked by the choice of the words. `Dwaipayana` meant that `Ganesa` being a humanoid, may be faster in word processing but he really needs to understand the meaning of the words.

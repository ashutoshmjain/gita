# A `Writing` Revolution


`Mathura` was the geographic center of `Bharata` — old India. It was also the center of mass adoption of `written-word`.


`Mahabharta` was scribed in eighteen `Parvas` (books). The first book - `Adi Parva`  describes the divine intervention to scribe the entire epic. `Mahabharata` is not only the longest poem, it was the first major narrative written down in text. Even if it wasn't a divine intervention, scribing such an immense scripture at that time, was no less than a divine grace. And `Vyasa` made a crucial point — narrating a scripture this complex to the masses, was almost impossible unless it was scribed first into written words.

‘Text’ was the new medium. It was somewhat similar to our migration from analog to digital. It not only needed the tools, it also meant the population must learn reading and writing, beyond a select class of sages and super sages - just the way we needed mass adoption of computers in early nineties and smart phones later. Superior intelligence `Ganesa` was invoked to usher the humanity into this new era, just the way we are using natural language processing in current digital realm. 

In a way, the ‘texting revolution’ was a bigger jump forward (than the digital internet), because we are talking thousands of years in the past. The legend says `Mahabharata` got to current state in over six hundred years. It was like the Wikipedia of that time. Every king, every invention of value, must find it's place in `Mahabharata`. There was an all around effort to reduce the cost while increasing the utility. `Maha-Bharata` is believed to be before `Panini`, who first standardised the Sanskrit Grammar. It is so because, `Panini's` grammar — `Ashtadhyayi` has references to `Maha-Bharata` and the flavor of Sanskrit is sure not same as that of `Panini`.  `Dwaipayana's` Sanskrit is called `Vaidik Sanskrit`.

It wasn't that no one knew scribing before, but the written word was discovered to cave walls, just like murals and wall carvings. The early books adopted similar techniques. Books were written on a human size posters made with cotton cloth and framed in wood. Instead of chiseling, they used colors of `Henna`, to paint the messages. Paintings and books were essentially of the same measure and medium. A painter could afford to spend an year on a painting but spending that much effort on a single page of a scripture was hell of an effort. 

In an estimate, a hundred page long book, printed on human size frame back then, used cost a gold[^gold] coin. The question was to bring the cost down to a silver coin. And bring the size down to a tenth of the human size. An order of magnitude reduction in size and cost, paved the way for large scale adoption of written words to scribe the scriptures. Does it sound like a journey from mainframes to to the smartphone?

What were the challenges and motivations that led to this major step up in human cognition? Why would someone want to scribe the entire wisdom in a single narrative. And most importantly, how was this wisdom tested before putting into text! 

Following pages are a filtered version of my study and imagination investigating that revolution. And not surprisingly, it makes a fascinating story! And also a reflection on why humans keep changing the medium in pursuit to climb the ladder of consciousness! They also answer one question that stayed longer on my mind — why should I care? Why should any one care!. Turned out, our moral and physical dilemmas are not very different from that time. As we are moving to increasingly digital world (think VR), we are trying to take books into the new medium - digital copies in same size and format! Maybe we are trying to write books on human scale posters! Do we need another way to retain knowledge in digital world? Is that new format social media or is it Wikipedia? Or we still need to find a new home for the knowledge — an order of magnitude more efficient! As we go through the story of creation of `Maha-Bharata`, we will discover many such questions. I can't promise all the answers because only time will tell, but we may together extend our imagination to that first shift, to get a better vantage of our current struggles ..

Let me rewind you to around seven-ish thousands years back. It is about the time `Krishna's` father was to be born at `Mathura` — a major pilgrim destination now, the foremost seat of learning back then ... and a major mishap occurred — something never heard before — and something that triggered the **writing revolution.**

[^gold]: Barter system was still widespread for the smaller transactions. Commoners used fruits and grains to get what they needed. Rich people used copper as a store of value. A one time adult meal was normally considered one copper coin. So was a ride fare. You could hop on and hop off any boat or cart at any place along its route for one copper coin. Super rich used copper for utensils at their home. For them the valuable was silver. A silver coin was considered same as ten copper coins. One each for every single finger of two hands. Ultra rich ate their food in Silver utensils. For them store of value  was a Gold coin. A Gold coin was equal to ten Silver's. One for every finger of both the hands. The valuation was based on rough order of magnitude in mining these metals. Silver was considered ten times harder than copper, and Gold being an order of magnitude harder than Silver. In a way "proof of work" was baked in universally acceptable currency. All states, no matter what their political equations, honoured this simple "proof of work" based storage of value. Privacy , self custody and universality were the underpin of trading system. Nation states couldn't even imagine to start their own currencies ! Currency was pegged to people's trust in "proof of work". Important point to note here, currency was not pegged to commodities such as iron. Gold, silver and copper were NOT commodities. Gold's only purpose was ornaments , silver was used purely for minting, and copper was primarily used for making utensils for the rich. Copper was supposedly the best metal to store food and water. Eating in silver, though common for rich, was considered a show-off.This simple to understand and time tested system of power of ten, was later exploited by `Aryabhatta` to conceptualize zero and decimal system - the very basis of modern arithmetic.

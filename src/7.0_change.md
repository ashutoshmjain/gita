They say change is the only permanent thing - why ? Even religion agrees on this with only caveat that God is immutable. Let us try to break it down in light with Gita

Gita says there are only two types of things ...

- One that change - `Kshr` - All of manifested universe is part of this 
- Other that never change - `Akshr` - The `Atma` [protected] knowledge is immutable. 

# You are The God

Specifically on this logic, if we assume religions are right, then we know for sure that Gita mandates no external God because `Atam` is you. That is a good news. 

The question still remains why change occurs in the manifested. To understand it , let us first see what exactly is manifested and how. 

# Manifestation

Manifestation is expansion of information. Information, by definition means something that can be informed. In other words it is something that can be experienced through senses. Everything that we can observe directly with our senses (or by enhancing our perception through tools) is essentially "information". As we saw in last section, information is `Shruti ` - something that can be heard ! Now of course we can read it or watch a video or even see face to face. A house is information. Clothes are information and so is a book. Everything is a `Shruti`. The Hindu scripture names few `shrutis` as the messages from kings and from the saints - Those were passed on a hearsay but broader definition is something that we can experience with the senses. 

On the other hand, knowledge is something that can only be experienced - it is beyond senses. It is beyond communication. Ask someone who creates a poem, sings a song or makes an airplane. An airplane is a manifestation. We can see it. But how it is created is so unique to the engineers who make it. You can't make a plane or music just by seeing a plane or a concert. You can't even read a book on automotive engineering and make a car . You need to engage in the action `Karma`. Practicing `Karma` as a ritual `Yajna` leads to the knowledge that eventually translates into the manifestation. Once something manifests - a meme, a joke , a rocket , a book or a poem - It becomes a `Shruti`. But the knowledge remains with the one who performed the `Yajna` as her `Smriti`. 

In a way the knowledge is like a little black hole in you. Even you can't see it with your senses. You really don't know how you hit the baseball so perfectly while others can't even connect. You have sure done ton of practice but what is in you to hit that ball is beyond you. Every one is, however, informed well when you hit the home run. That is a manifestation of home run. You can make it an NFT if you want :-)

At the same time you do want to tell them all about this thing. Words alone don't help - why not just sing that song. Why not fly a drone - The knowledge drives the urge to share. How you package the information to share is upto you. May be you are a master of words , or you are an engineer - the way you share is what you manifest - that other conscious agents could touch and feel. What you can't share is the knowledge. Your `smriti` dawns on you through `yajna` but stays with you. 

## Lifecycle of Manifestation

I guess a serialized list is the easiest way to communicate but the reader knows these things may occur out of order or might even overlap ..

- A desire takes birth  - `Icha`
- You take a vow to make it happen - `Sankalpa` - Starting of a `Kalpa`
    - You start the actions - Start of `Yajna`
    - Phase 1 - You gain tremendous knowledge. Every session is opening up new things - `Sattva`
    - Phase 2 - You have something already in you but you don't know how to communicate it. You are in constant struggle with in you if it should be revealed, if yes how ? Is album a right way or a single chart .  Or should I make it a concert ? Should I make it free or charge for it. Will others get advantage of my creation ? You spend a lot of time in this though you still continue to practice. The hopes are high. Ideas are good - Basically you spin on three legs. Enjoy/ decrypt the knowledge, figure out the shape of information , figure out the manufacturing process - `Treta`. 
    - Phase 3 - Knowledge is complete. Artifact is ready. Reveal the information or not - `Dwaper`
    - Phase 4 - Information is fully baked in , you automate the information dissemination - It could be home runs, a you tube video , millions of copies of the book you wrote, concerts - `Kali`.
- End of Actions - End of Yajna
- Desire is fulfilled - If the outcome was favorable - you are happy, otherwise it is a pain. 
- Information is consumed by the target conscious agents. It is stale , useless . A book on the shelf that you don't even care to dust. - End of `Kalpa`. 
- The knowledge is still in decrypted stage with you. You can see a many new possibilities that are hidden to others. You will need to gain more knowledge to realize those possibilities - hence a new desire. And start of next `Kalpa`
- And the cycle continues. 


You continue to decrypt the knowledge and manifest. Information keeps getting added till there are possibilities to decrypt the knowledge. You exit the game when the knowledge is fully decrypted - `Nirvana`. 

Information keeps on adding and keeps adding and getting stale. The stale information is all the unconscious universe we can observe but it is not current. These automated artifacts run our universe but we don't pay any attention. No one opens the refrigerator compressor to figure out how it cools as long as the damn thing works. All you care if the beers got chilled or not 

# Change 

Since conscious agents are continuously decrypting the knowledge and thus manifesting , the universe around us keep changing. Someone added a new planet to our information base couple years ago. We are adding black holes now on daily basis. Well new iPhone comes only once an year .. Better order on before they launch a new model :-)

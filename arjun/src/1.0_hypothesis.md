<center><h1> Chapter 1.0</h1></center> 

Gita proposes a simple hypothesis to explain the nature of "reality";  and a framework to exit the maze. It is not wrong to call it a maze because we barely understand how this all works. It looks similar at sub-atomic level as it seems at the astronomical scales. In fact , the sub atomic level has turned really crazy. We now have a God particle! We can't predicate as to what transpired at the beginning and what does the end look like!  Hard problems of science aside, we have little handle on our own body and mind. Despite all the material consumption, we are emotionally drained - evident in our substance abuse and suicide rate. An average American family spends more on meds than on food. 

The Gita Framework resolves many of our burning questions, or at least attempts to set priorities for our strife. The later is more important because even science appears to be all over the place ; least said about the degradation of religions. In a way Gita, gives necessary structure and skeleton to our quest - scientific and spiritual. And it gets more relevant in these asking times, when on one side imminent  opportunities (think artificial intelligence, robotics , space and biotech) are hitting exponential trajectory, and on the other more than half the humanity struggles for elemental air and water. There was never a bigger demand on humans to choose right from wrong and then stay focused on path. 

## The Hypothesis

Gita  proposes a distributed model of knowledge. 

>> A full copy of  [protected] knowledge `Atma` is pre-built into all of us. We being the conscious agents `Jeeva` . Protected because, this "knowledge" can not be destroyed by "worldly" means. Metaphorically - Fire can't burn it. It can't be drowned in water ...

The "know how" to harness the energy is implicit in this knowledge. Thus a worldly metaphor would be a combination of DNA and Electricity but Gita says that this can't be perceived by our normal senses. In a way it is encrypted `Avykta` to our externally focused mind and body. BTW, this is not a call for the blind faith. We will see down the line in this book as to why this knowledge is encrypted and how we can perceive it without using the survival oriented senses. 

Since all of us get a full copy of this knowledge and the energy to act, we are free to choose our actions. Our Actions `Karma` determine what we finally shape into from our physical body standpoint and what we manifest in the world. We have full control on our `Karma`. 

## Worth knowing and Knowable. 

Gita says, this [protected] knowledge is all we need to know . 

Worth knowing because the answer to all the questions that we are seeking outside, is already embedded with in us. Since it is  built into us, it is called `Atma` which literally means "Me". In essence, this knowledge is what we are. Our Physical body (and mind) are primary tools to enable "Actions". Like all other tools, they too decay with time. We sure need to take care of the tools but that care is meaningful only if we know who we are. 

>> The good news is it is "Knowable". The bad one is it appears encrypted to our externally focussed senses. 


Just as a Black hole, though beyond our observatories, we can affirm the existence through what it does. The best way to approach this inner knowledge is to observe the "Actions" it drives. The process of getting attached to (focusing on) the "Actions" is called `Karm Yoga`.

Let us start the journey ..

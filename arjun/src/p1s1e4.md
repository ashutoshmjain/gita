### 3.10

Saha [along with] Yajnah [ritual of actions] Prajah [community of followers] Srishtva [having created] Pura [previously anciently] Uvacha [I said] Praja-patih [to the care taker of community like a king who is supposed to serve the community on my behalf];

Anena [ by this] Prasvisydhvam [ having attained more prosperity] Esah [ throgh this] Vah [s/he] Astu [stayed as] Ishta [ desired things] Kama-dhuk  [ owner who enjoys his rein].

{ Along with Yajna ,  I first built a community of followers and appointed and explained the purpose of Yajna to a community leader; with which s/he attained all s/he desired and enjoyed what s/he got } 

(The biggest of all discoveies is the formation of organization for a righteous purpose. This is the key differentiator between animals and humans. Even animals and insects organize for self help but none does so for the righteous. Krishna said that he is the one who brought who invoked this idea along with Yajna itself. Most of the successful people as Krishna was are the ones who indulge in actions without association , desires and they do it dexterously in a balanced manner ; their selfless actions develop a community of followers . Having figured out the Yajna and the community, they pass on all this as a heritage to a deserving community leader who takes pleasure in maintaining and growing the ritual . Thus Krishna asks Arjuna to follow such Karm Yoga , just like him . Even becoming a community leader is a far less than the true potential we all carry )

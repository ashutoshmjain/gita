Sun had already gone down as king hurried to the docks. `Maharishi` had suggested many times to have the king spend a night at `Ashram` for finding a return passage at this hour might be difficult. Boats stopped plying with the sun set. Little did he know that king had already planned his return. 

As they reached closer to the bank, king could see a single boat. And he got the unmistakable  musky smell as the wind turned a corner towards them. `Satyawati` had asked `Dashraaj's` youngest daughter `Saryu`, who still worked on the boat, to return back home with gold coins for she didn't want to have the gold on them as the evening approached. The older sisters were already married in nearby village. `Saryu` offered to stay back though she wanted to be the one to handover Gold to her father. 

`Satyawati` was sure, by now,  `Dashraj` must be celebrating the unexpected bounty, with his undercover `Asura` friends, who stayed in the village having received the immunity from `Maharishi`. She told `Saryu` to let `Dashraj` know she might be very late for she had promised the rich farmer a passage back, and she was anyway used to be on the river in nights. It was not the first time `Satyawati` decided to stay back on the waters. Many of such nights she been to the island, alone, rekindling the memories of her days with `Maharishi` and `Krishna`. Her hopes of seeing them again diminished as the time passed. Sometimes, she wondered, if those days actually happened. Five years was a long time and each day was a battle with herself. She wondered the moment we get everything we ever wanted - in her case beauty, fragrance and success - we immediately start craving for something else. She also noted that her cravings slowed down as the time passed. They were always at the back but she learnt to live with them and now she was probably ready to move on. 

She was quite surprised when she saw the farmer being escorted by three `Yogies`. She already knew he wasn't an ordinary man for no one would gift gold for a boat ride, but the fact that he was escorted by `Yogies` meant he was lot more than his appearance. She thought to herself - Who exactly is he? Then she saw a boy walking behind them. His dark complexion mixing with the ensuing darkness of the evening. Her heart skipped a beat for a premonition told her it was `Krishna` - her son.

The older `Yogies` knew her well from their frequent visits to the village and they had taken her boat number of times to cross the river; but `Maharishi` had made sure he and `Krishna` never crossed her path. 

If this is `Krishna`, why did `Maharishi` send him this time? — she thought — Is there a message?  

She was still wondering when `Lomaharshana` one of the older `Yogies` bowed to her and asked - `Maa` (means mother but this is a standard way for `Yogies` to address older women), are you planning a ride across the river ?

`Satyawati` woke up from her thoughts - Yes `Yogi`! - do you all want to go across ?

No `Maa`, only `Maharaaj` would like to go back to his camp on the other side. We are happy to come with you, should you need someone with you on your return for safety. Or we may wait here till you come back. - said the `Lomaharshana`.

That won't be necessary `Yogi`. `Yamuna` is like my mother! I am safer with her than any place on earth - `Satyawati` smiled - btw, you said `Maharaaj`? Of where? - `Satyawati` asked folding her hands.

`Yogi` almost bit his tongue. He didn't realize that `Shantanu` was under cover and the thought that he blew king's cover hit him like a brick. 

`Krishna` quickly understood the situation. He was about to intervene but `Shantanu` stopped him with gesture of his right hand. 

`Devi` (a common address for an upper class woman), I am `Shantanu`, king of `Kuru` Kingdom - He said, knowing there was no harm in losing his cover. In fact, he thanked the fate for making it easy to let his true identity be revealed to `Satyawati`. For one he was tired of playing the "hide and seek" through out the day, second he did want `Satyawati` to know who he was. It had be hard to reveal it himself. That would seem as if he was trying  to impress her with his position though he actually wanted to do exactly that.

`Satyawati` didn't know how to react. He had the most powerful king right in font of her and possibly her long separated son too. She remembered the words of `Maharishi` - "You will rule the world". She was, however, not aware of the weight of such a reality! 


She almost sat down by the weight of the moment. She had thought about `Maharishi's` words almost every day since she left him and `Krishna` behind, but she didn't realize the physical truth would be so much bigger, and so abrupt, and shocking. She felt excited, overwhelmed and hundreds of more emotions striking like a thunderbolt. As the moment passed, `Satyawati`, once again staged a quick recovery. She readied herself for the enormous opportunity destiny had delivered on her hands.

`Krishna` moved a step closer and held her hand. Being a child it felt okay for him to hold the hand of a woman almost her mother's age. He didn't know yet he was holding his real mother. 

And who are you `Yogi`, never seen you around - `Satyawati` asked to reconfirm her premonition. 

I am `Krishna` `Maa` - Son of `Maharishi Parāśara` - said Krishna, oblivious to all that had transpired to get to this moment in time.

And who is your mother `Krishna` - `Satyawati` wanted to see if her son knew his own roots. When she saw `Krishna's` face blanking out, she asked - How would you know everything that is there to know without knowing who you are?

> How would you know everything that is there to know without knowing who you are?

A simple question, yet so profound. `Yogies` left the banks as king and `Satyawati` boarded the boat. On his way back, `Krishna` thought why did `Maharishi` never brought the topic of his mother. Why such a simple truth is hidden from humans. Why don't we automatically know our lineage? - our oldest history.

Any other child would have rushed to his father to check who his mother was ? But `Krishna` was no ordinary child. That night, `Krishna` climbed his favorite tall tree and sat there. This was his den when difficult questions troubled his child mind. If `Maharishi` sought not to tell this simple thing, there must be a reason — he thought — more importantly does every manifestation hides something? 

Is Sun and the moon and the mother Earth, that we perceive with our senses, hide something behind the perceivable. If that was true, would it be right to say bigger the manifestation, bigger was the hidden truth? Then what is the biggest manifestation of all? Isn't it the human body itself? What does this body hides behind it? Is it what `Maharishi` calls `Atma`? He didn't know when he slept, on the tree. Many questions still unanswered but he knew what to ask. And he also knew truth must reveal itself if we asked the right questions. 

`Maharishi` had told him never to seek answers — instead, seek the right questions to know the truth!


----

As the boat merged into the waves of `Yamuna`, `Shantanu` too wanted to seek the truth — from himself. Is he open to a new relationship or he must carry on with the memories of his past? 

`Yamuna` was shining bright with the young full moon. As the boat got stable, `Shantanu` thought `Satyawati` would sing a song. Five minutes into the ride , he asked her if she didn't like to sing in the evenings? `Satyawati` was caught off-guard — `Maharaaj` I have never sung in front of a king. I am not sure if I am talented enough to indulge you in my music. 

King stood up from his seat and walked close to `Satyawati` — your song was probably the best I have ever heard. May I know your name? And what family you belong to? — `Shantanu` was eager to break into a conversation. The desires that were born in the morning, were now playing all sorts of tricks. Alone with her in the night, on calm `Yamuna` with slight breeze, and musky smell surrounding him like a thick fog, he could have easily blamed the moon for turning his mind upside down. And he justified his thoughts based on what `Krishna` said this morning — a king must give the empire a worthy queen. Is she the one he was looking for all his life ? Is it the time he must move on from memories of `Ganga`. Why should he bear the loneliness when it was `Ganga` who decided to move on ?

`Maharaj` my name is `Satyawati` and I am daughter of of the village head `Dashraaj` — `Satyawati` wanted to make sure king didn't go deeper into her identity. She didn't want the word `Matsya` re-tagged back to her. 

King took a closer look at her. In her late twenties or early thirties, she still looked like a girl. And her musky smell got even stronger as king stepped closer — Are you married `Satyawati` ? 

Her heart skipped a beat, but right after, a smile came on her face — a confirmation that she knew her future. `Maharishi's` words seemed true now — One of them might take you as his wife and there after you will rule the world" . The king of largest empire known was asking a fisher girl if her heart was free to take him in. She found the desire to rule the world building up in her groin. This is her moment. She was not meant to ferry a boat all her life. Her life has a purpose. But she must use this opportunity. She looked at the King. Her eyes gazed deep into `Shantanu's`. With a smile on lips — what do you want `Maharaj`? Of course I am not married and there is none in this village that might win my heart!

King got first glimpse of her eyes. Deeper than `Yamuna`. He found himself lost. And that smell. He couldn't figure if it was real or a dream. All he knew that his truth was right in front of him. She was the one. His soulmate and the queen of the kingdom. He must not let this moment pass without avail. He slowly moved his hand to take one of hers — Will you be my queen and come with me to the royal palace?

`Satyawati` blushed. As beautiful as she was , she looked even more for she found her own kingdom in the heart of `Shantanu`. King's heart was clear. And his touch the warmest she had ever felt. A part of her wanted to give her entire self to `Shantanu` right there, but the reason prevailed. She let `Shantanu` take both her hands — `Maharaj` you will need to speak with my father if you must take me as your wife !


`Shantanu` was pleased with her acceptance and valid pre-condition. It showed she could exercise her will but still maintain the tradition — a pre-requisite to the highest position of royal queen.  — he thought — She is definitely not the one to slip for his wealth and why should she?  Gods have gifted here the best of looks , voice , smell and mind. Bowing down on one knee `Shantanu` took out a ring from his little finger and proposed to her kissing her hands — Sure, I will meet your father tomorrow soon !

`Maharishi` woke up in the middle of the night. He wasn't able to get to sound sleep this night. Something, he felt, was going on and it wasn't that he met the king or his proposal was accepted. Destiny was weaving a web at deeper levels that he didn't have ready access to. As he stood up to drink water, he saw through his window, `Krishna` was sitting on his tree. He understood `Krishna` must have met `Satyawati`. That meant King had met `Satyawati`. The pain of the thought was his truth.

As he sat down he wondered if he did right to keep `Krishna` away his mother? He felt proud on the knowledge he demonstrated this afternoon but his knowledge needed impregnation with reality. He must indulge in something physical. He needs to find his purpose.

`Dashraj` had a night of his life. First he thought how to hide the Gold. Once properly secured, he headed to the local pub with "drinks on me" slogan. All his friends ate and drank belly-full till the middle of the night. On his way back, he marveled at his genius for having found a cash cow in `Satyawati`. And then he worried if she left like older girls to marry someone. He must crop any plans of her wedding even before they get framed. `Satyawati` was his path to riches and a daily celebration on the local pub. With the money he had, he was planning to set up a small metal shop to make finest hand-crafted swords. This would be his passage back into the politics of `Kansa` now that `Maharishi` was dethroned. He must set the plans fast in motion.

--- 

The ride back to his camp was lost in time for `Shantanu`. He didn't know when he started and when he reached the camp. Sleep was no where near the king. He was planning the communications he must send tomorrow morning. One to his son `Dev` for deploying best of his river crew for the island. Second, to `Kansa` for the deal of the island. And third, and probably most important, to `Dashraj` for a face to face meeting. Should he go to his home or should he invite him over. He thought later would be appropriate because he didn't want to step into `Kansa's` land. His own life seemed precious now. 

---

`Satyawati` didn't go home that night. She spent some time on `Yamuna` and took another trip to the island. As she stepped into her cave, she felt calm as if surrounded in a mother's lap. She was excited but she wasn't sure how `Maharishi` was feeling right now. Does he know? He does know everything. Does it mean she would never be together with `Krishna` ?

---

`Yamuna` the river, spoke to `Mathura` the city that night — to let her know that her times were changing. Very soon, `Mathura` would be the most important city ever in the history.

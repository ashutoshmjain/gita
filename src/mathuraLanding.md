`Mathura` was the geographic center of `Bharata` — the old India. It was also the physical origin of auspicious scriptures - `Vedas`. And the mass adoption of the written-word. `Mahabharta` was scribed here -  in a series of eighteen `Parvas` (books). The legend says that `Mahabharata` was too big to scribe for humans. Thus the writer - `Krishna Dwaipayana` summoned help from `Ganesa` - the elephant God [picture above]. Considered as embodiment of "intelligence" in Hindu belief system, `Ganesa` is also known as `vighn vighnesh` - the biggest problem solver - obviously on account of his super natural intelligence - almost like still elusive "artificial general intelligence".

‘Text’ was the new medium. It was somewhat similar to our migration from analog to digital. Not only did it demand new "scribing" skills, it also meant the populations must learn to "read" -  beyond a select class of teachers or sages. New tools such as Pen, Ink and Palm leaves were invented; just the way we needed mass adoption of computers in early nineties. Divine intelligence `Ganesa` was invoked to usher the humanity into this new era, just the way we are using "large language models" in current digital realm. 

The written word commanded as much attention back then  as the "code" in our times.  Which meant iterative rigor to precipitate the words into immaculate verses - such that the message stayed in the human cache. The upfront effort to organize scribing paraphernalia (palm leaves, ink etc) was an entry barrier. It justified that the text must be accurate, succinct and comprehensible to the highest standards.

The legend says `Mahabharata` got to it's current state in over six hundred years. It was like the Wikipedia of that time except it was also poetry of extraordinary caliber. Every king, every invention of value, must find it's place in `Mahabharata`, but in a fashion that was both - readable and sonorous. The superfluous vastness of current (digital) knowledge store, on the other hand, necessitates that a new conscious form must replace humans. Or humans amalgamate with AI tools. Good or bad ? - only time shall tell!

Any major paradigm shift, mandates an order of magnitude improvement. There was an all around effort to reduce the cost while increasing the utility. It wasn't that no one knew scribing before, but the written word was pegged to the cave walls. Like murals or wall carvings, text was written on human size posters. Instead of chiseling, they used colors to paint the messages. Paintings and books were of the same measure and medium. An artist could afford to spend an year on a painting, but spending that much effort on a single page of a scripture was hell of an effort. Even if someone willing to put in the effort, the language model and calligraphy weren't mature enough to capture the essence of the spoken words.


In an estimate, a hundred page book, printed on human size frame back then, used to cost a gold [^gold] coin. The goal was to bring the cost down to a silver coin. And bring the size down to a tenth of the human size. An order of magnitude reduction in the size (and hence the cost), paved the way for large scale adoption of written words. Does it sound like our journey from mainframes to the smartphone?

What motivations led to this major step-up in our approach to preservation of information? Why would someone take the pains to poetically scribe entire history? How was wisdom drawn off the history and more importantly, how was this wisdom tested for truth before putting into text? 

Following pages are a filtered version of my research investigating that revolution. And surprisingly, it made a fascinating story! They also answer one question that stayed longer on my mind — Why should one care for the pen and the paper? What value in spending cycles on the tools of a bygone era! Turned out, our challenges and  moral dilemmas are not very different from that time! The essence of a "paradigm shift" is more or less similar. There is a lot to learn!


### notes and stuff
----

[^gold]: Monetary system - no one knows for sure when gold mining begin. Our current estimates are [ around 4000 BC ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_mining). That puts it around the same time as  `Mahabharata`. The frequent mention of Gold ornaments among kings and deities and as jewellery among women indicates that usage of Gold as a scarce but fashionable store of value -> [Ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_mining)
- In Mahabharata, there is a clear mention of gold coins being abundantly used. In fourth book - `Viarata Parva`, the prince `Uttara` offered `Arjuna` (disguised as a transgender named `Vrihnnala`) a hundred gold coins for saving him from `Kaurvas` -> [Ref](https://mahabharata.shutri.com/maha04.html?highlight=gol#virata-parva:~:text=%27Listen%2C%20O%20good,set%20me%20free.%27) . 
- There is evidence of countable units of precious metal being used for exchange from the Vedic period onwards. A term `Nishka` appears in this sense in the `Rigveda`. A unit called `Śatamāna`, literally a 'hundred standard', representing 100 `krishnalas` is mentioned in `Satapatha Brahmana`. A later commentary on `Katyayana Srautasutra` explains that a `Śatamāna` could also be 100 `rattis` (almost equal to a `Tola` that is used for gold trade todate in India). All these units referred to gold currency in some form but they were later adopted to silver currency. -> [Ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinage_of_India#:~:text=There%20is%20evidence,16%5D%5B17%5D)
- Barter system was widespread for the smaller transactions. Commoners used fruits and grains to get what they needed. 
- Rich people used copper as a store of value. A one time adult meal was normally considered one copper coin. So was a ride fare. You could hop on and hop off any boat or cart at any place along its route for one copper coin. Super rich used copper for utensils at their home. For them the valuable was silver. 
- A silver coin was considered same as hundred copper coins.  Ultra rich ate their food in Silver utensils. For them store of value  was a Gold coin. 
- A Gold coin was equal to hundred Silver's.  The valuation was based on rough order of magnitude in mining these metals. Silver was considered hundred times harder than copper, and Gold being similar orders of magnitude harder than Silver. In a way "proof of work" was baked in universally acceptable currency. 
- All states, no matter what their political equations, honoured this simple "proof of work" based storage of value. Privacy , self custody and universality were the underpin of trading system. Currency was owned by people NOT kingdoms! It is a well established fact that after the great war of `Mahabharta`, sixteen main kingdoms (`mahapadas`) got formed over couple of centuries. Each one of them issued their own coins but they were all different shapes or stamps on gold coins. Quarter gold coins (`Svarna`) are excavated from `Gandhara`.
- Currency was pegged to people's trust in "proof of work". Important point to note here, currency was not pegged to commodities such as iron or wheat. Gold, silver and copper were NOT treated as commodities. Gold's only purpose was ornaments , silver was used purely for minting, and copper was primarily used for making utensils for the rich. Copper was supposedly the best metal to store food and water. Eating in silver, though common for rich, was considered a show-off. 
- This simple to understand and time tested system of powers of ten, was later exploited by `Aryabhatta` to conceptualize zero and decimal system - the very basis of modern arithmetic. The seeds of Abrus precatorius (`ratti`) being very consistent in weight were used  to weigh gold using a measure where 8 Ratti = 1 Masha; 12 Masha = 1 Tola (11.6 Grams), or roughly equal to 96 Ratti pure gold and 4 Ratti impurities to solidify the gold. In simple calculations ten grams of gold was worth one kilo of silver or hundred kilos of copper. Or one Ratti (tiny seed) of Gold was equal to one kilo of copper.

Bhagavad Gita is the first `Smriti` in Hindu scriptures. What exactly is a `Smriti`? To get an answer, We need to go back in time - at least five thousand years!

<div style="padding-left:40px;font-size:0.9em;"> 

In the beginning there was `Om` - vibrations of the underlying field.  Spoken language originated from this source. Humans developed exceptional conversations, but everyone had to individually remember the contextual history.

Then we discovered scribing!  Given the difficulties of early days, only most precious information made it to the written form. The word "scripture" points to something important enough for everyone, and worthy of writing down.

> Written text, thus,  became the collective memory. In Sanskrit, collective memory is deemed  `Smriti`.

Before we learnt writing, critical information was passed on through rigorous recital - not mere "word of mouth". Such information was called `Shruti` - communicated through superior and repetitive oration. The Sanskrit word later morphed into `Shutri` in Hindi.

In modern parlance, World Wide Web is like `Smrities`, and Podcasts are akin to `Shruties`. Given that it is way easier to scribe text and record audio these days, we now have zettabytes  of information, so much so that it is humanly impossible to scrape through, besides the quality is questionable!

Thus looking at the first `Smriti` opens up a profound source of wisdom - it is like finding true signal with in myriad of noises.

`Arjuna`, the protagonist, is blessed with divine vicinity of `Krishna` as his charioteer.  `Krishna` - the knower of all - is the consciousness prebuilt into all of us. Just as in AI realm, the formulation of prompts is the key skill, `Arjuna's` questions represent most intriguing human dilemmas. In doing that, he enabled rest of us with an opportunity to access our own soul.

`Arjun uvaach` - the name of this publication - means `Arjuna` spoke - his heartfelt queries.

`Arjuna` was a life-long friend, and student of `Krishna`. His voice stands for the questions we mortals have when tested and confused. And also the magical discernment once `Krishna` unveiled knowledge unto him. Their conversation, amidst the battlefield of Kurukshetra, is among the most potent narratives ever penned down - `Bhagvad Gita` - gods' song!

At the end of this conversation, `Arjuna` said :

> `Nashto Moha , Smritir Labdha !`
>
> [I am] devoid off of illusions, [I] attained the universal wisdom - the collective memory!

</div>

It is not uncommon to experience a momentary relief from cyclic illusions (`Moha`). Such instances - typically a deep loss - often lead to depression. They leave the disillusioned in a vacuum. `Gita` on the other hand, spotlights truth through wisdom embedded in our intelligence (`Smriti`). `Gita` gives us tools to open the door to the very basis of our intelligence - our soul (`Atma`). Instead of a run to exit (`sanyasa`), `Gita` welcomes the precious gift we all are endowed with - human experience. It, thus, provisions lasting peace and worldly success - a win-win.

`Gita` is for everyone - it is not religion, race, profession or place specific. It is not even an ideology in terms of renunciation or materialism. In that, it takes our mind to a place of freedom, rather than the jail of a rabbit hole.

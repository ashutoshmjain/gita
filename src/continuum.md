Many people believe our sensory reality is an illusion. They find indulging in actions in this reality meaningless. They feel our unidirecional arrow of time is somehow a jail that doesn't let us move freely back in the past or forth in future. Gita does agree that here is a deeper truth that is beyond our sensory reality. In fact, to symbolyze this cyclic circular nature , Krishna bears a circular `Chakra` on his little finger, but he says 

> Evam [thus] Pravartitam [ transformed ] Chakram [ cycle] Na [ no] Anuvartaytih [ adapts and practices; follows] Iha [ in this life] Yah [ one who];
>
> Agha-Aayuh [ lazy, sinful life] Indriya-aaramo [ seeker of sense gratification] Mogham [ uselessly] Parth [ Arjuna] Sah [ that person] Jeevati [ lives].
>
> Thus , one who doesn't adapts and practices this transformed cycle ; Such a lazy sinful person , seeker of sensory gratification, lives uselessly. 
>

As we talked in the last section, our sensory reality - our tiny box is the only field of actions available to us what Gita refers to `Kurukshetra`.  This is what we observe through our senses and this is where we engage with our action organs . The  obvious thing is all our observations are based on our senses . We can extend our senses with say tools, the machines or apparatus of science but any scientific observation , weather we use a powerful microscope or a large telescope , finally needs to be interpreted by our senses. Thus we can say our reality is basically a "Sensory Reality". Even this post that you are reading is because you are using your eyes or ears if you are hearing it. 

## Nature of our observations.

Observations are always of a finite duration. There is always a start and an end.  Just like any scientific observation, our own physical journey has a well defined start and a unique end. The most obvious fact of our life is it has finite duration. We were all born on a specific date . And we will sure die some day. There is no denial to this truth because this phenomenon is under our constant vigil - 24 by 7. Our life is our longest and most meticulous observation. And the good news is we don't need any apparatus of science to observe our life. We all have all the sensors, millions of them , pre built into us to test this sensory reality - the reality of own lives.

The thing about start and end is we can't fully perceive the boundary conditions. From boundary conditions, I mean the split second before the start and same after the end . We are always uncertain as to what led to the conditions where we are starting to observe and what happens after the observation. For example none of us have seen ourselves taking birth and nor do we know anyone who could describe the experience of their death. 

You may say our own birth and death is kind of a unique situation because we didn't have fully developed senses at the time of our birth and in kinda similar fashion, our senses bail out on us when we are experiencing death. Absolutely true. And that is exactly what I am saying. The underlying reality precedes the inception of our sensory capability and it continues long after . Even if we do crowd sourcing , our collective experience here in this universe is a tiny fraction. In other words , we can expand our observerations as much as we want. There is almost infinte space to venture into.

The other way to look at it is - if we were certain about the immediate past or the future of our observation, then they are also part of our finite observation and then again we don't know what happened before or after . There is always something before we have complete knowledge of the process and there is always something after we close. We can continue to expand that split second to  say for 13.8 billion years and reach the start of the universe but there is still scope to pre-pone our start . It doesn't really matter if we are talking of our own birth or the birth of this universe , or for that matter any other sensory observation , there is always something more to know - something that created the conditions of our observation . Or something that created (or expanded) our sensory perception itself. 

We can verify this idea at both micro and macro scales. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle proves limitation of our observations at the subatomic levels. On the other side,  we now assume that universe expanded in a split second before we have scientific fact of observation . We do have a concrete scientific evidence in cosmic microwave background radiations that take us as close to say four hundred thousands years from the big bang . And indirect evidence through gravitational waves might take us down to a pico second - a trillionth of a second close to big bang but there is still a pico second - and a vast unknown before that. That split second is what science believes where this universe became one from zero but it is beyond our observations.

However, we should not conclude that this limitation is somehow giving us a compromised version of reality. We will see down the line that this is all part of intelligent design or evolution - which ever camp you belong to :-)

## Arrow of Time

If we leave the murkiness before the start aside and the same that exists after the end of the observation, we can attach specificity to these two points. May be with some assumptions. Our senses are designed to take the shortest distance between these two points - the fastest way to consume. In a scientific observation we know this as "accuracy" of the machine.  We want our instruments to take precise measurements as quickly as possible. Faster the better. In normal life we can call this sensory attribute as "survival". Survival of the fittest means the most accurate and fastest way to consume what is available to our senses - food , information and entertainment - everything that we can perceive with our senses. 

In other words , this specific start and end is what gives us the illusion of linearity of time - the arrow of time. We can say, linearity of our time is an outcome of our sensory observations because senses always want to take the shortest distance, the straight line. Why so ? 

It is because of the desires. Let us take a deeper look at the desires. 

## Desire

The definitive thing about our sensory perception is we always want to know about that split second. What happened just before the start ? And what is going to happen after the end. And it is quite logical. Let us say we are looking for a needle in a 'proverbial' haystack. The most logical way is to split the stack in two and search first half. If we found the needle, we don't need to search the rest. Else look for the rest. Thus looking for outside our observation space is a part of our sensory algorithm.

We then split the rest in the two halves and repeat the same operation. If we continue this operation many times, the stack gets smaller and smaller. Kinda like a straight line. In computing world we call this algorithm "Map Reduce". Google search is based on indexing and "map reduce" though it sure has ton of more sophistications unknown to us mere mortals :-)

If we don't find the needle at all in our stack, we can add little more of the hay from the field and repeat the same operation. In a way we always want to expand our sensory observation till we find what we are looking for. This algorithm of splitting the observable space in two and targeting one at a time is what we know as a sine wave function. Sine Wave is oscillation of our focus in one half and than another . As soon as we find our desired object - our needle , the wave collapses. 

If we don't find what we are looking for , we keep on extending our search space. It is because of this reason we have already expanded our tiny box from our own lifespan to the lifespan of the universe - 13.8 billion years. Our tiny box is now a big universal box :-) , though we now have more questions than what we started with :-) The quest is endless and so is the supply of 'proverbial' hay. We can expand our search wave as long as we want. Smaller the wave amplitude , more like a straight line it is. And also there is no point in looking at the hay stacks that we already searched. That would be an awful waste of limited resources our senses have. So it is efficient to make the algorithm unidirectional. And particularly , if we know that the things are going to repeat in a circle as we will see in next few paragraphs when we look at our physical and meta physical systems.

In a way, wave function collapses as soon as we observe the particle. Or we can say , the particle appears because we are looking for it. But our senses have one more trick up their sleeves. As soon as we find what we were looking for, we deploy our senses into next quest. Again this is about maximising the usability of our senses. We don't want our machines to unnecessarily idle.

Krishna says .. 

>Na [nor] Hi [certainly] Kashchit [anyone] Kshnam [a moment] Api [too] Jatu [at any time] Tishthati [stays - sit down] Akaram Krit [doing nothing];
>
>Karyate [forced into] Hi [certainly] Avashah [helplessly] Karma [actions] Sarvah [All] Prakriti-Jaih [born of their nature] Gunaih[qualities]
>
> No one can sit idle even for a moment, at any point in time. All of us are forced into actions based on the qualities born out of our nature. 

This expansionary and ever engaged nature of our sensory perception is what we know as "desire". Desires are what makes us expand our sensory footprint. We want to have bigger home, bigger and many cars just the way want to know everything in our universe and beyond. Before our universe and after it. Thus sitting idle is not an option. If that is the case, why not engage our senses in righteous actions. 

Now that we have a good handle our unidirectional arrow of time - our sensory reality,  the question is what is underlying reality ? To make it easy to comprehend , we need to review our observation space. 


## Physical and meta-physical

If we see closely as to what we perceive, there are two types of systems in our sensory reality. The physical systems that we can perceive with our senses - we can touch or feel them; for example the earth as part of the solar system, or even the tiny atomic particles that we can observe through our extended senses. 

On the other side we have meta-physical systems. These systems are based in some physical system (or a mix of them) but we extend them further. For example a class room is based on physical four walls of a room in our primary school, but a class is lot more than just a room. It is a place for learning , networking and so many more things. We spend most of our lives in these mental constructs. These systems govern most of our sensory observations. Even if we observe, pure physicality, our interpretations (of observations) are invariably in the context of a meta-physical system. Even the scientific observations are with in some community, some society or some project. Unlike the physical systems, the meta-physical systems are highly elastic. We can easily shrink or expand them based on our desires . Thus desires exist in these meta-physical systems. 

Most of our scientific quest is focused on our physical systems but it is not a very useful aid to resolve the conflicts of our meta-physical systems. Thus we end up expressing (not measuring) our meta-physical systems through arts or social science. The good news is , both physical and meta-physical systems have one thing in common. They both are continuously spinning. 

## The spin.

In our physical systems everything and everyone pulls everything else towards its center. Newton named it Gravity. Gravity is a fundamental force. This constant and impartial pull towards the center, gives everything a circular shape. Or a spherical shape if we want to see it in three dimensional model. Effectively in a large enough physical system, once we reach an equilibrium of some sort everything becomes spherical. We see it in planets , stars , galaxies and even in black holes. We know for sure that central pull exists no matter the size or shape. 

Inherent in this notion (of gravity)is the idea that we are also being pulled by everything else. Towards their center.  The existence of two such forces - inwards ; what we call centripetal force and outwards what we know as centrifugal force (may be due to the rotation) is a hallmark of every observable physical system. Btw we now know that gravity can be inflationary . If the core is made of energy rather than compact matter , gravity is repulsive. The key thing to note is  the circular or spherical nature of our physical systems is more basic because that is preexisting to our observations of inwards or outwards pull. Two opposite forces exist because there is a continuous spin. 

This outwards pull is what gives the stars and planets their orbits or their identity because otherwise they will just fall into the central one. Lighter things revolve or rotate around more more massive things. Thus the notion of a system in which everything is spinning about itself and also rotating around something else. Planets rotate around sun. Sun rotates around a massive black hole at the center of the milky way and who knows milky way is rotating around some super super massive black-hole at the center of the universe. We don't know ..

Now in physical systems, we might see some particles or say some meteorites, that don't seem to obey this rule . They seem to be on their path but we know sooner or later they will merge into a planet or a star. Even the photons (light) shall bend around if the gravity is strong enough - say in a black hole. 

Even in the meta physical systems - say a class room. A teacher is the central force . In a family mom holds the strings together. In a nation there are governments as the central force and in business there is always a nasty boss looking over our shoulders :-) In a way , the meta physical systems are not that different from the physical systems - when it comes to the shape . They may not appear to have a spherical shape but the very idea that there is a central agency, means they are spherical in nature. If we try to represent a top down meta-physical model geometrically , we will end up into a circle on a 2 dimensional paper. In essence a circle or a sphere is the most probable configuration of our systems. 

![circularNature](./au-circularNature.jpg)

So we get it that our meta-physical systems are circular, but how do we know they too are spinning ? For that we need to expand our observation window to a slightly bigger horizon. For example - if we see the political history of any nation, the same set of ideologies rule the nations in a circular fashion. Liberals and conservatives take their turns at the helm one after the another. If you heard your parents, the advise is never to throw away your old clothes because the fashion repeats itself in about seven to ten years. Now you may not be able to fit into the jeans from your school but still you can always keep them  to remind you of your bulging waist line :-) Mark Twain once said that history doesn't repeat itself but it always rhymes. 

The other way to look at the circularity of the underlying manifestation is to see it from a distance. In our physical systems, the Earth appears flat because we are very close to it but Sun and Moon appears circular because they are at a distance. The notion of "distance" in our physical systems morphs into a "dispassionate view" in our meta-physical systems. If we are too much vested into a political party, we feel that four years after the loss had never end. And after a win, we feel as if we are never going to lose again. The truth is all the empires fall no matter what ideology they have . This cyclic nature hints at the circular underlying reality of our meta-physical systems. 

A wave is nothing but an elongated observation of a circle. Every crest must follow with a trough. It also means that if history is repetitive (or rhyming) , we don't need to go back in the past. Neither do we need to traverse to the future because future is anyway going to come to us. A more efficient use of sensory apparatus that is busy in search is to wait for the next iteration of similar events. Thus it makes sense that our sensory reality is unidirectional and we are banned from travelling back and forth in time. Thus a unidirectional arrow of time with a cap on time travel is the most optimum set up for the search and that is what our sensory reality is provided that the underlying field is rotating in a circle. The best way to visualize it is a vinyl record. The pin stays at it place while the record below it spins. With every spin the pin gets to the next trench on the vinyl. History repeats but always with fresh music ..

If this is so, the question is what is the purpose of our  linear stable reality ? There must be a good reason for us to chase survival ? The simple answer is nature is allowing us to build the skills.  In a way , our sensory reality is our training and testing ground. It is the launch  pad that enables us prepare for the next rhyme of the history. 

## Why Skills 

The notion that history repeats itself though always with a new(er) set of circumstances, means we can leverage the skills we develop but each time with a new set of challenges. Thus building skills is a useful exercise. Gita says building the skills is collection of something called `Daivy Sampad` - divine wealth. The  system - `Bramha` can assign us certain tasks only if we have some skills. That is very easy to understand. In our workplace , we get to do specific jobs based on what our skills are.  If you are a good coder , you will get to code. If I am a good writer , I will get to write the  documentation :-) . Again, this is not to say one skill is better than other. All the skills are equally important. In the bigger universe, insects breed to clean up the mess, then other species evolve to clean up the insects. Thus evolution is about application of skills based on new set of realities. 

## Evolution 

The idea of evolution is very succinctly captured by Darwin in the phrase - "Survival of the fittest" . What does it mean to be fit ? Fitness is not about killing others. It is in being most skillful at the task that we are designed to do. In a way, evolution is baked into the intelligent design. Intelligent design in the sense that all species have a specified task and evolution in the sense that every new iteration of the cycle offers them new challenges. The current challenge for human race is to keep the planet habitable or make us a space faring species. In essence evolution means the most efficient application of our skills. The question is how do we develop such skills. 

Gita suggests `Yazna` - ritual of actions ; as the means to perfecting our skills . 

## Yazna

Let us say you want to research on cellular biology. You want to understand it inside out. I guess you will grow the cells in a lab. May be from stem cells or some other tissue depending on what aspect you wanna study. It is almost impossible to understand cellular mechanism without having a real cell in your lab. And obviously, you need a lab. A lab is a place where you can remove all the external interactions. You can create a focused environment to study the scope you have in your experiment.

Think of `Yazna` as one of such focused environments that we create to figure out the true nature of underlying reality. `Yazna` has many aspects but the core of it is building a skill - doing all the things that you will otherwise do to build a skill in real life but doing so without attachment to worldly expectation. Why ? Because we want to remove all the "desires" from this particular observation. We want to see what happens if we take an elongated observation without the influence of desires. We will talk in great length about the skill building aspect of he `Yazna` in the section on  "Practice and Skills"  ; suffice to say here that Krishna says .. 

> Yajna-arthaat [Done for the sake of Yajna] Karmanah [actions] Anyatra [otherwise] Lokah [world] Ayam [this] Karm-Bandhnah [bondage by work];
>
> Tat [For it] Artham [for the sake] Karm [righteous actions] Kaunteya [O son of Kunti] Mukt-sangh [liberated from the curse of association] Samachara [do dexterously and balanced].

> Things that we do for the sake of `Yazna` - the ritual of actions, are `Karma`. Rest everything is a bondage to the pseudo reality. Thus do your  actions, liberated from the curse of association , external influences `Muktsangah `and with equanimity `Samachara`- looking at the things without any bias. Being `Muktsangah` and `Samachara` are the prerequsites to create a pristine lab - A lab where we want to act without desires. 

In a way , the very definition of `Karma` is the actions that we undertake to accomplish a `Yazna`. I may also add that `Yazna` is just part of `Karm Yoga`. `Karmyoga` includes righteous applications of the skill we build through `Yazna`. In a way, our linear reality is a lab where we can conduct `Yazna` and in addition it also provides us an opportunity to test those skills. 

Coming back to our example of cellular biology. If someone questions as to why are we conducting the experiment in the first place. May be we want to bring out a vaccine . May be we want to solve the mystery of cancer. May be we just want to understand how the cells actually work. The first two are called `Sakaam Yazna`. The last one , where we only crave for the truth is called `Nishkaam Yazna` - A `Yazna` without desires. You may say there is still a desire. A desire to know the truth . And you are right in your assessment. Even `Nishkaam Yazna` has an underlying desire for true knowledge but given that we already have a physical body ; we can't reach a state of `Absolute No desire` unless we know the truth. Thus this last desire is a valid one - the desire to know the our inner self. Our own copy of true knowledge. The true nature of our underlying reality - the continuum.

----

To sum it up and recap , Gita says that our senses are there to provide us a virtual world to hone our skills. We don't need Godly intelligence to navigate our simplified interface. Our tiny box is as important as the underlying so called true nature. We have both the "intelligent design" and the "evolution" simultaneously at play.  Intelligent design is in our stable unidirectional sensory reality but the underlying spin ensures we must evolve with every iteration. The circular nature of our underlying reality also means there is no beginning or an end of our universe. The start and the end is creation of our senses because we must start our quest at some place. To symbolise this circular continuum , Krishna bears a circular `Chakra` on his finger but there is no reason to assume underlying infrastructure is any better than the virtual overlay or vice-versa. 

Our goal is to develop the skills based on our opportunities in this tiny box. We test and apply these skills in this virtual world but the process of attaining these skills and their righteous application, makes us aware of the underlying cyclic nature of universe - both at physical as well as meta physical levels. At this stage, our internal knowledge is easily accessible to us. In other words, perfecting our game means exit from the game. The way to perfect our skills is to get a handle on our desires and indulge in ritual of actions `Yazna` without the curse of association and biases. Once we are one with our internal knowledge , our `Atma`, we are in unison with the cyclic nature. We are beyond the feelings of happiness and pain and we attain eternal peace. At this stage , we are even beyond the "actions". We appreciate the beauty of this creation and enjoy a lasting peace. He says ..

A skeptical mind is a good thing. After all, we owe our survival to our ability to question everything that comes our way. We must take on a direction only if it appeals to our rationale - beyond dogma and hearsay. 

## Is [protected] knowledge a carrot ?

It is easy to black-box our questions into an unknown variable and have us perform certain activities before the variable is exposed. Only to find later that black-box was actually an empty box. Is the concept of `Atma` , the [protected] knowledge one such black-box. I also challenged the concept with the same argument. Here is my rationale before I took on the journey. 

### It didn't ask me to give up anything. 

I love my life. Frankly, there are not many complaints. The ideas of Gita appealed to me because it is not asking me give up my life for a strange unknown blessing. 

### No religious overload .
It didn't ask me to visit a temple or light up the candles at a church. In fact it didn't sound religious at all. It calls for realization of your inner "self" and it says when you know yourself, you are the God. 

### A very different approach 

It came as a fresh air to my goal (outcome) oriented thirty years through the corporate ladder. Everything should not be a calculation. I should be able to do things just for my (inner) sake. 

### Made me more effective 

Being attached to "Actions" made me more effective at my chores. I got better at fitness. Once I stopped chasing a number for "Financial Independence" and started focusing on right investment actions, the number automatically came through. 

**All above are good, but the thing that really won me over ...**

## The sharp logic 

If we start a game, a common perception is that there are two possible outcomes  - You win , or you lose. You win means you are happy, you lose means life sucks. In a normal game, if you keep on losing, ultimately you will run out of the chips or the casino will close (assuming you are not at 24 X 7 Las Vegas :-) . 

**So the third possible outcome is the game ends**


>> What if we are in a game that can't be stopped ....ever. 

Isn't life one such game ? Leaving the concept of reincarnation at a bay (for the time being ) - I asked myself - Is it possible to be alive but not play the game ? 

### Can I pack my cards ? 

The obvious answer was to get to a sustainable financial independence[FI], resign the regular job. Try to live with in my means. I did that .. But many of you who reached FI will vouch - the game doesn't stop. Portfolio,  pandemics and politics never stop. And of course the body itself needs you to go on .. It goes on and on . Only the  events change - cycles don't. Desires , happiness and Pain are kinda built into us. No matter where you go , no matter what you do your mind can't get over the game . 

There seems no option to pack the cards ,  sit in the casino bar and just enjoy a drink - no game. 

>> Even if I don't "use" the exit, there must be one. Where is my third option ? To just "be" .. at peace. I thought doing "nothing" might work. It doesn't. 

It just seems unfair that I was neither asked if I wanted to play in the first place, nor do I have permission to leave. On top of that - the reincarnation thing (if true) sounds as if , I am stuck here for the eternity. Isn't it ?

## Gita's take on this HARD problem .. 

Gita says where the world looks at only two outcomes - heaven or hell ; both being here in this life time,   there does exist a third option - `Nirvana` - that is to exit this game . Heaven is symbolic of the pleasures of favourable outcome - hell is quite the opposite - the sustained stay of pain. But there is no "Peace" if that is what exit looks like. 

Krishna says - `Nivana` is the real victory and that is the real goal. And he proposes `Karm Yoga` as the only path. In essence, Gita gives a new destination and also paves the singular path to it . Why only ? Because all other paths will finally lead to `Karm Yoga`. 

In nutshell, it says that the pains and happiness are attached to the "expectations v/s outcomes".  If  favorable we are happy , Otherwise not.  Actions, on the other hand, have two different properties - peace and knowledge. If you focus on actions (and do them as a ritual - `Yajna`) you will attain the peace and decrypt the  knowledge. And finally this knowledge automatically solves the puzzle and thus exit - `Nirvana`. 

>> And here is the Kicker - It says that you don't need to perform any special actions ... All you need to do is just change your approach to "Actions" .. 

### No Brainer

That sounds like a no Brainer.. Isn't it ? If all I need to do is change the approach to things I anyway do - invest in stocks,  love my dogs, run , chat with friends, take care of a family , drink some good wine 
and come up with occasional tweets :-)  ; then obviously there is no down side to trying out `Nirvana` route ..

### Alexa - put me on `Nirvana` mode

Unfortunately , Alexa still doesn't have the `Nirvana` skill :-) . So the journey is really to learn (and experiment) how to focus solely on "Actions" . Without any consideration to "outcomes". 

Turns out it is harder than what I thought. Desires creep into every thing we do. Thus `Karm Yoga` is a skill , just like playing the Violin. The good news is Gita has the information. We still need to practice though because just information is not sufficient. Gita is experiential. 

Even better news is, the work done on this path never goes wasted. This assurance comes from the "auto save mode" :-) Krishna knows, we will wander off track ; get swayed by the desires- thus the assurance that once you start on `karmYoga` , just like swimming , you will never forget it. You can always come back at any point, reset your password (if forgot), and get started from where you left .. 

### Isn't Nirvana a Desire ?

Yes it is, aspiring to exit is also a desire (outcome) ..what a catch :-) .. 

Gita says - only till you are learning . Once you attain `Karm Yoga`, even the desire to exit vanishes - thus the eternal peace. Exit happens whenever it needs to happen .. At this stage you are not even a `Karm Yogi` ..you are simply a `Yogi`  - means connected.

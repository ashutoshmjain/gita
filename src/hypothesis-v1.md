# The Power of a Foundational Assumption

All great leaps begin with an assumption—a foundational intuition upon which we build frameworks of logic, language, and science.

In the mid-nineteenth century, physics was anchored to a core assumption: all waves need a medium. Sound travels through air, and ocean waves through water. Therefore, it was believed, light must travel through an invisible, all-pervading substance called the "luminiferous aether." This idea was the cornerstone of cosmology, a necessary explanation for how light could traverse the vacuum of space. To question the aether was to challenge the very essence of logic back then.

Some time around middle of nineteenth century James Clerk Maxwell arrived on the scene. In 1865, he made an audacious intellectual move: he completely ignored the aether. Instead of convoluting its physical properties to accommodate his ideas, he proposed a new, radical assumption. He declared that at every point in the universe—in the vast vacuum of infinite space, the air we breathe, and even in the gaps between atoms—there exists an invisible field. He named it elctro-magnetic field though we shall refer to it as Maxwell's field - easier and and more intuitive!

This was a philosophical earthquake. Maxwell proposed that electricity and magnetism were two aspects of this single field. A disturbance in one would create a disturbance in the other, resulting in a self-propagating ripple that needed no medium, for the field *was* its own medium. 

And here is why the idea struck the scientific chord! When Maxwell calculated the speed of this ripple - using two experimentally established constants of nature—the permittivity (ε₀) and permeability (μ₀) of free space—the result was precisely the speed of light. An absolute constant!

This created a profound contradiction. The aether theory demanded that the speed of light be relative; an observer moving toward a light source through the aether should measure a faster speed just as one would see a train approaching faster if she was running towards the train. But Maxwell's equations predicted a single, absolute speed for light, derived from universal constants that did not change. The observer's motion was irrelevant. It seemed as if light was more fundamental than all other worldly things. The idea of "relative speed" it appeared, didn't apply to light.

This new assumption, and the mathematics it produced, not only shattered the idea of the aether but also challenged long-held Newtonian physics. The aether was banished not by a direct experiment to find it, but by a single, magnificent, and daring thought. Maxwell's true legacy was the boldness of his assumption. He dared to imagine that the universe was not empty, but filled with an invisible, active, and infinite field. This paved the way for Einstein, who would again revolutionize our understanding of our "relative" reality by uniting space and time.

> Trivia: if the constancy of light's speed is central, why did Einstein name his work the "Theory of Relativity"? The name is admittedly confusing. It doesn't imply that the speed of light is relative. On the contrary, the theory is built on the principle that the speed of light is the only universal absolute.
>
> Einstein's theory is named "Relativity" because in order to protect the constant speed of light for all observers, something else had to give. What gave way were our commonsense notions of space and time. The theory revealed that measurements of mass, time, distance, and even simultaneity are not absolute, but are in fact *relative* to the observer's motion. Time can slow down, and lengths can contract, depending on one's speed.
>
> So, the theory is called Relativity because it uncovers the relative nature of space and time, a profound insight forced upon us by the absolute, unchanging speed of light.

The core take away from Maxwell's field and Einstein's application of his ideas to break it down for us mere mortals is - the reality as we perceive in mass, spatial dimensions and time are relative i.e. they are emergent - the only consistent thing is the underlying field of light. It is beyond human abilities to explain where did this field come from. Who created it ? But that didn't deter science to indulge in the concept of "fields". In fact, modern science has completely given up on our reality - they are all fully convinced that reality emerges from underlying unknowable fields!


## A Different Starting Point: Consciousness as the Field

Maxwell's field was just the beginning. Modern physics, with quantum field theory, now proposes at least **seventeen** such fundamental fields—one for electrons, another for photons (light), and so on for every elementary particle of which there is no dearth. While this model (commonly called standard model) is incredibly powerful, it raises a philosophical question. Are we, like the nineteenth-century scientists, trying to explain everything through a complex system of "many fields"?  Are we doing to idea of "Maxwell's field" what our older folks were trying to do with "Aether"? 

May be our assumption of reality is flawed like the ideas of "aether" back in the Maxwell's world?

> What if physical reality is an emergent property of something more fundamental? What if we are trying to learn the underlying code by breaking the computer screen into ever smaller pixels - the elementary particles. Yes that knowledge is useful, but only from material science standpoint. The clues for the origin (and dissolution) of the world are somewhere else.

Vedic science offers a different starting point. It postulates that the fundamental field is consciousness - an equilibrium state of three esoteric qualities ; not two as Maxwell had assumed - remember permittivity and permeability constants. These qualities of consciosness are called - Sattva, Rajasa, Tamsa. These qualities, just like consciousness itself, are not physical - but we can feel them just the way we can feel the life with in us. A ripple in this underlying field creates super intelligence (`Mahat`) aka large language model of Vedic science. It lterally means greatest intelligence. `Mahat` in turn gives rise to localized identities. Identity develops senses. The senses then construct the physical world we perceive. In a striking similarity - Vedic view of creation is lot closer to modern AI model than to Quantum attempts to explain the reality.

In `Vedic` view, our world is a form of virtual reality generated by consciousness. But here is a crucial difference - this virtual reality is created inside out, not outside in the way we experience normal VRs of our time. 

We don't jump into Vedic VR, we create it around us.

> The key difference lies in the foundational assumption. Modern science assumes consciousness emerges from a physical substrate. Vedic science posits the opposite: the fundamental field *is* consciousness, and everything else, including the physical world, arises from it.

The important thing to understand is Vedic Science doesn't negate concepts like evolution or individuality. Evolution is the key driver for rise of "intelligence". Conscious beings are continuously evolving into better configurations to improve the quality of purpose fit intelligence. Improvement in intelligence leads to better identity.

This is easily understood now that we are at the cusp of artifical super intelligence. Think of a post AGI hybrid world: a superintelligence may create new robots. Each robot, endowed with a ripple of intelligence, develops its perception tools and interacts with others, including us. There senses attuned to their tasks. And their perception of universe vastly different from us. 

We can argue that other species say dogs sense and perceive the world very differently. Butterflies develop sensors based on what they need to survive and thrive. Their perception of reality is vastly different yet always evolving. In essence, it is hard to fathom that we are any special.

Similarly, the Vedic model accounts for individual agency and interaction between conscious beings, each an emergent property of a universal field of consciousness—the divine. We are like ripples in this field, interacting with infinite other ripples. It is not a single player game.

## Gita's Framework: The Hypothesis of Inner Knowledge

This power of assumption is central to Gita. Just as Maxwell assumed a universal field to explain energy, Gita proposes an underlying reality of consciousness to explain the individual. We cannot perceive this divine reality directly with our senses, but we can experience its effects.

Gita's great framework, introduced by Krishna, is that a divine intelligence resides in all of us. He called it `Atma`—"the Self." It is our own copy of complete and unaltered knowledge, seeded deep within us. This idea posits that a ripple in the underlying field of three forces—Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas—captures a piece of consciousness and binds it to the physical. The physical body itself is then created by this tiny seed, much like a tiny seed in a mother's womb becomes a 2,000-pound gorilla.

This idea was beyond imagination just a couple of centuries ago, so it was often wrapped in belief systems. Today, however, we are accustomed to scientific ideas that defy intuition, like quantum mechanics and relativity. We accept them because of their testable predictions. Science has shown that our sensory reality is limited. With this understanding, we can explore the possibility that there is more to reality than what our senses report.

Gita proposes a hypothesis: a distributed model of knowledge that is protected, immutable, and encrypted. A full copy of this knowledge, `Atma`, is pre-built into every conscious agent, or `Jeeva`.

### Protected and Immutable
This knowledge cannot be destroyed by physical means. As Krishna says, weapons cannot cut it, fire cannot burn it, and water cannot wet it. It exists beyond the physical realm. This knowledge is also `Akshara`, a Sanskrit word meaning "that which is unchangeable."

### Encrypted but Knowable
This knowledge is not easily perceived by our externally focused senses and mind, which are designed for survival. The truth, therefore, appears encrypted, or `Avyakta`. This encryption is not a permanent barrier but an invitation to engage with the physical world, for it is this reality that holds the key to our inner knowledge.

The "game" of discovery exists because the experience is beautiful. Our physical reality is meticulously crafted, but its immersive nature can be addictive, and we can lose our way in a cycle of happiness and pain.

Since everyone's circumstances are unique, each of us has a unique set of "cryptographic keys." The method to decrypt the underlying truth is necessarily individual. "Encrypted" does not mean "impossible"; it means we need the right key. Once we have it, the entire knowledge base becomes self-evident. This is not a call for blind faith. As in any scientific inquiry, we start with a hypothesis and test it through experiment.

### The Ultimate Knowledge
Gita claims this inner knowledge is all we need to know. It is **worth knowing** because the answers to life's great questions—chief among them, "Who are we?"—are already within us. Our external quests are ultimately a search for ourselves.

It is **knowable** because it is built into us; it is `Atma`, "the Self." Our physical body and mind are tools for action. To let this beautiful apparatus go without decrypting the knowledge within is a wasted opportunity.

We can approach this inner knowledge as we approach a black hole. We cannot observe a black hole directly, but we can affirm its existence through its effects on the space around it. Similarly, the best way to understand our inner knowledge is to observe the "Actions" it drives. The process of focusing on these Actions is called `Karma Yoga`.

### The Knowledge Network
If the path is individual, are we alone? No. The decrypted knowledge manifests as everything we perceive. Our individual decryption leads to skills that can manifest things in the world. The collective decrypted knowledge of all beings is what Gita refers to as `Brahma`.

This vast network of consciousness manifests our perceivable universe. In Vedic traditions, `Brahma` is the entirety of the system, the overarching reality that provisions everything we need for our life's experiments. It also gives us the challenges we need to solve based on our unique circumstances. In essence, this collective decrypted knowledge gives us our purpose. As Krishna says in Chapter 3, Verse 15, righteous actions (`Karma`) are born from `Brahma`, and `Brahma` is born from `Akshara` (the immutable knowledge). He concludes:

> *"Therefore, the all-pervading `Brahma` is eternally situated in the ritual of action (`Yajna`)."*

## A Balanced Path
For the last century, physicists have sought a "Theory of Everything" to unify relativity and quantum mechanics. A true theory of everything, however, must also account for consciousness. On the other hand, some philosophies devalue our sensory reality, claiming it is merely a projection of our minds.

Gita establishes a balance. It affirms that we must have the deepest appreciation for our physical reality because it is the field `Brahma` creates for us and holds the keys to our inner knowledge. Gita rejects asceticism for its own sake and insists that we cannot achieve a state of inaction without first performing action.

> *"No one reaches a state beyond action by merely abstaining from work. Nor can one achieve success by renunciation alone."*

Gita provides a framework for both our scientific and spiritual quests. It offers a theory not just for the cosmos, but for us. It provides a path to live better, act righteously, and find peace. This message is more relevant than ever in a world of exponential technological opportunity and immense human suffering. There has never been a greater need for humanity to choose right from wrong and stay focused on the path.

Let us begin the journey.

In the words of Professor Freeman Dyson, "The ultimate importance of the Maxwell theory is far greater than its immediate achievement... It is the prototype for all the great triumphs of twentieth-century physics... All these theories are based on the concept of dynamical fields, introduced by Maxwell in 1865."

These qualities, like consciousness, are not physical. A ripple in this underlying field creates intelligence, which in turn gives rise to identity. Identity develops senses, and the senses construct the physical world we perceive. In this view, our world is a form of virtual reality generated by consciousness.

We see this in nature already: dogs, butterflies, and bats sense and perceive the world in ways we can hardly imagine, each developing senses based on what it needs to survive and thrive. Their realities are different, yet always evolving. It is hard to fathom that we are any different.

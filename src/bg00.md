The purpose for Converting **Bhagavad-gītā** into English poetry, albeit through AI, was to make its profound teachings more accessible, engaging, and emotionally resonant to a wider English-speaking audience, particularly next generation. Gita is immutable, but the metaphores used to explain dense topics need to be time and place specific. That is where tools like Gemini Deep Search and notebookLM come in handy. 

The audio quality and diction of NotebookLM is extraordinary. It is like a superior intelligence learning and rendering an epic from superier intelligence ( Vyasa and Ganesa).  That said, everyone sees their own reflection in Gita. It is a poem written such that the meaning is always complimentary to inner state of every single listener. Thus it is perfectly alright to ignore what you hear in these episodes, and let your own imagination take over!

The original Sanskrit verses were sourced from [SanskritDocuments.org](https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_giitaa/bhagvadnew.html).  Show is available through  any podcasting app that supports [Podcast Index 2.0](https://podcastindex.org/podcast/7267041)

For best listening experience, please visit chapter pages by clicking the  cheeseburger on top left <i class="fa fa-fw fa-bars"></i> . There, you can listen to Spotify feed while reading the verses.

`Anyaay` means injustice.

Good and evil co-exist in the present — in every moment, in every interaction. They are literally the two sides of a coin. Everything in this world may be seen as "Good" and the same from a different vantage may be seen as "evil". This is what underpins the cyclic nature of our tiny box — the dualistic nature of our being. 

In most of the cases, the equations of good and evil balance out. They do in the tiniest moment and they obviously do so in the eternity. The balance endows perpetuity to our universe - `Bramha`. But once in a long while - evil may overpower the good. How to balance such an event ? That was the question that `Dwaipayana` had no answer to. Only `Bramha` ( through it's manifestative property) could reveal the answer, for no human , not even the divine writer could speculate such a pre-meditated balancing act of nature. 

He writes in `Gita` that `Vishnu` himself told this secret. His seventh incarnation, also named `Krishna` tells `Arjuna` in the middle of battle field.

Only when the evil crosses human capacity to launch a legit response, `Vishnu` must incarnate to restore the order. He must show, by example, the "code of conduct" in most difficult situations. 

# Anyaay ...

With the massacre of that fateful morning when every one in `Vasishtha's` congregation was killed for no apparent reason, `Maharishi` thought `Mathura` had seen it's share of injustice. And he believed, justice was served through his fire traps. As able as he was, in ability to see the past, observe the present, and forecast the future; he couldn't be more wrong ; for the biggest act of injustice was still to happen. That too in in his back yard, `Mathura`. Time had come to witness the free fall of human values — the very erosion of kindness. 

Time has also come to catch on the story of `Kansa` that I promised in previous chapters. Evil had made `Kansa` it's vehicle to serve the ultimate injustice — something that was impossible to be balanced even by compassion of `Maharishi`.

Most people brushed the prophesy aside as a ploy of `Kansa` to keep `Vasudev` in house arrest. Few , who believed in such things thought that it is somewhere long in the future. It had take couple of decades for `Devki` to deliver eighth child who the prophesy suggested would kill `Kansa`.  Who knows it would ever happen and who knows what had be the power equation then. `Vasudev` , `Devki` or even `Kansa` could die. Their minds might change to find lost love between the brother and sister. There were numerous possibilities. 

`Vasudev` and `Devki` themself didn't think there was any danger to their expected child. The first one of their wedlock and sign of their love through thick and thin.

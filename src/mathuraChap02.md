Aging `Bramh-rishi`, with his sons lost, found hope in grandson  `Parāśara`. Legend says `Parāśara` showed tremendous intelligence right from the early age. Exaggerations point that he recited hymns in his mother's womb! That said, `Vaśiṣṭha` had little hope elsewhere. As `Parāśara` was growing, `Vaśiṣṭha` rebuilt the congregation ground-up. New students, new methods of teaching. This time he wanted to scribe the scriptures to safeguard against another similar catastrophe. 

Young `Parāśara` had the advantage of full attention of his grand father but life for him was harder than other student. He was expected to learn scribing in addition to speech training that most kids his age did. Learning to scribe was an optional course that few students took after completing their normal course of studies - may be at an age of twenty plus. `Vaśiṣṭha` wanted `Parāśara` to learn the symbols simultaneously as he learnt to speak - somewhat like our education system where we start "A for Apple" showing the toddlers a written symbol of letter "A" and "Apple" together. The grandfather used to take the budding child to the river `Yamuna` to play and draw the symbols on the sandy banks with a stick. `Vaśiṣṭha` had no clue how scribing the entire knowledge base would fructify but he knew a mighty ocean started with a single droplet. His goal was to prepare `Parāśara` as first child natively raised with scribing and speech together. He wanted to understand if it was even possible, and if it was, than what is the effect on child's approach to learning. He knew if he could train one child for the written word, than at some point in future, all could adopt the same method instead of a typical learning path focused solely on the art of speaking. And if everyone knew writing, than writing the `shruties` would be an easy shared effort. This approach, now a days, is used by many parents who want their children to natively learn coding but we are getting ahead of ourselves. Let us first see what a typical learning path was ..

A typical path for an aspiring student (`Vidyarathi`) seeking a degree in the authentic "recital" of scriptures (`Shaastras`) was to join a congregation (`Ashrama`), on a full-time live-in basis. Life in an `Ashrama` was tough. A student was expected to follow a tight celibate routine, full of chores and services. Before s/he got to the lessons, s/he must prove s/he was worthy of the knowledge. Then only s/he would make it to the choir. Menial tasks were considered mandatory to mellow down (or even eradicate) exaggerated notion of ‘self’ and be one with the all pervading `Bramh` - the knowledge graph. The wealth of congregation didn't make it any easier for the students, because the wealth must be spent to help the needy. Even `Parāśara` didn't get a free pass when it came to the rigor. Quite the opposite — he had to double up.

 A degree holder was called a `Snataka`. A `Snataka` needed to go through rigorous years of apprenticeship with a teacher `Aacharya` to get certified in administering ‘rites’, when s/he was called a `Shastri` — someone who knew scriptures. At that stage, s/he could leave to spread the rites in the villages near or the cities afar, or become an `Aacharya` (a teacher) in the congregation. The choice was based on her inclination and the rigor s/he wanted to put in becuase being a teached needed lot more studies while a rites maker could start living a normal life immediately. Only few `Aacharyas` with demonstrable authority on all the known scriptures would get to the coveted title of `Vyasa`. In nutshell, there was a whole organization to moderate, curate and to disseminate the audio content — to make sure the knowledge was passed-on (without distortion), to seekers in current generation, and the next.

There was another path available to the students if recital wasn't their strong suite — research — seeking knowledge (`Nyana`). This path demanded lot more patience and even greater sacrifice!  If someone was keen to take on research, after graduating as a `Snataka`, s/he would choose a major in a specific field. The hard work on this path was called `Sadhna` meaning extreme focus on a specific goal (`Sadhya`). One who accomplished her goal was called `Sidhah`. 

This path led to titles such as `Rishi` — a sage; and `Maharishi` — a super sage. These titles were given by a community of researchers based on the body of work or the insights one brought to the world — a complete meritocracy without any consideration of gender or race. The spoken insights of such sages were adapted into ‘rites’ by `Vyasas` — to disseminate, and to preserve the knowledge. Rites were a foolproof method to embed these insights into public discourse.

Rites were conducted to invoke natural powers of the elements through human intelligence. For example, metallurgy and irrigation were outcomes of such rites, an invocation of power of elemental Earth and Fire. Agriculture was outcome of Earth and Water put together with specific human rigor. In essence a rite was a laid down controlled procedure that led to a specific outcome. Given the rudimentary level of knowledge, many things could go wrong. There were many unknowns because knowledge had yet not turned into hard ‘engineering‘. All the unknowns in a specific endeavour were humbly acquitted to the ‘deity’ of that specific field, to dispel uncertainty. It became customary to worship the contributors of that field to enhance the chances of success. Or to reduce the chances of mishaps. In a way, the faith in a ‘deity’ was nothing more than hoping for the best outcomes. Hope remains a powerful driver to this date. Human journey is a journey of hope.

A derivative rite known as `Dravya Yazna` was particularly popular among the rich and the powerful. Instead of rendering the rigor of the endeavours, it focused on honouring the deities. It entailed sharing homage and chanting `mantras` to invoke the deities, in return of speculative material gains. `Drvya` in Sanskrit, means material. Thus, `Drvya Yazna` literally meant the rites performed for good-luck material gains. For example, a rite performed for more rain (by appeasing `Indra` the deity of rains) was a type of `Drvya Yazna`. So was a rite performed to seal a wedlock with an expectation to have the happy matrimony last till death. The effectiveness of `Dravya Yazna` was questionable, but the essence was to bring a glimpse of ‘research’ to the masses. It also well served another goal — to fund the research. 

The formalization of family rituals into `Dravya Yazna` — sanitization of space (`shuddhikaran`), holy fire (`Agni`), intonations in carefully perfected ensemble (`mantrochhaar`), the time and the place (`Dasha and Disha`), and the specific order of homage to various deities (`Aahuti`); served two purposes. First it became a formal auspicious way to celebrate certain life events — such as child birth, marriage, retirement and even death. Second, it created an interaction platform between those who were seeking a higher purpose on one side, and the rich affluent pillars of society who hosted the rituals on the other. After the rite, there used to be an abridged message read by the ritual maker, in local dialect, to explain the relevant scripture, followed by QnA sessions — more you ask, more you please the deity. 

The hosts got the satisfaction of pleasing the deities while the ritual makers got plush donations — grain, cattle, precious metals. A big share of donations went to the central congregation — the source of wealth for the congregation - `Kaam Dhenu` - the virtuous cycle of knowledge to wealth. Many millennia later, the model still works in India. The classical music is still learnt in `Gharanas` — a diluted version of `Ashramas`. Each with their own style of renditions. The singers graduated from a specific `Gharana` of `Hindustani Sangeet` say `Kirana Gharana` have a life long bond to the origins of their art form, and are a source of continued alumni support.

It might feel as if `Dravya Yazna` was a sham, but the truth is it was a carefully thought out intervention to keep the society in certain checks and balances and to incentivize the ones who were dedicating their lives to carry forward the ‘pre-scientific’ exploration. The research was not limited to spirituality or meditation. It was well organized learning process that paved the way for scientific discovery in fields such as medicine, agriculture, irrigation, construction and many more. `Krishna` wrote later in `Bhagvat Gita` — a central piece of epic `Mahabharata` — that the idea of formalization of rituals in this format, was institutionalized by `Praja Pati`. Many religious accounts believe `Praja Pati` is a name for `Brmha` himself, who coded the basic laws of civilization and whose ideas seven [^seven] `Bramh-rishis` adopted as inheritance from father to son. Others believe `Praja Pati` is a deity responsible for administering the realm. Whichever point of view we may consider, the literal meaning of the word is self-evident. It means one who sustains the network. `Praza` means the subscribers of a system, `Pati` means one who takes care or owns those subscribers. 

`Krishna` wrote in chapter 3 of Gita :-

> Saha [along with] Yajnah [ritual of actions] Prajah [community of followers] Srishtva [having created], Pura [previously anciently] Uvacha [explained] Praja-patih [`Bramha` himself, or a demigod in Hindu scriptures responsible for administering the realm ];
>
> Anena [this way] Prasvisydhvam [having attained more prosperity] Esah [through this] Vah [they] Astu [stayed as] Ishta [desired things] Kama-dhuk [owner who enjoys his blessings].
>
> Previously, in the ancient times, `Prajapati` institutionalized `Yazna` — a well-defined ritual of actions, and explained it to a community of followers. Practicing this as a framework to build new skills — mining, metallurgy, agriculture, trading etc. or adopting it as `Dravya Yazna` for public engagement; they all got their necessities (and niceties) and stayed satiated.

Rites were baked in reality. For example someone starting an agricultural season, would conduct a ritual that underscored the right methods of sowing seeds, irrigation and harvesting. Someone starting a business would conduct a ritual that emphasized the accounting principles. The ritual maker who officiated a wedding must be someone who deeply understood the responsibilities a couple was taking on when getting into a wedlock — the vows. And one conducting a ritual after someone's death must be proficient in making the grief easier — like a therapist. Since all such endeavour had a significant risk of failure, there was nothing wrong in having blessings of Godly deities on your side. Humility was considered a virtue and it remains so even in the biggest scientific missions to date. 

Re-instituting this age-old model based on spoken words,  was easy for someone like `Bramh-rishi Vaśiṣṭha` for the know-how to set up this channel was already rooted deep in him. However, textification of scripture was lot harder than he envisaged. For one, the core infrastructure was not in place — the tools for writing long texts were just not there. It was one thing to write a short, cryptic pigeon message but writing a scripture was a whole new territory. Humanity had yet not discovered paper. There was no standard long-lasting ink. Above all, there was no standard Grammar. It will be hundreds of years before `Panini` — a grammarian par excellence, standardized the `Sanskrit` grammar [^grammar]. More importantly, there was no commercial payback mechanism associated with text, the way `Dravya Yazna` was associated to the spoken words to sustain the audio content.

He thought his grandson `Parāśara`, now reaching maturity, would take on this challenge. Little did he know that focus on texting the scriptures, would create a dual among his own followers.

## research and notes:

[^seven]: Hindu scriptures believe there were seven `Bramh-rishis`. `Vaśiṣṭha` was one of them. The other six are `Bhrigu`, `Agniras`, `Atri`, `Vishwamitra`, `Kashyapa`, and `Shandilya`. All of them originated from `Bramh` with the gift of intelligence to cumulate the knowledge. The only exception is `Vishwamitra` who is said to have attained this highest title through sheer hard work and dedication (`Tapasya`). All of them, put together, are also called `Saptarishis` - the seven.

[^grammar]: Vedas are written in `Vaidik Sanskrit`. `Panini's` epic book `Ashtadhyayi` refers to `Mahabharata`, which means `Panini's` Sanskrit came later than the times of `Krishna`.

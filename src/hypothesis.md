# The Power of a Foundational Assumption

All great leaps in understanding begin with an assumption—a foundational intuition upon which we build frameworks of logic, language, and science.

In the mid-nineteenth century, physics was anchored to a core assumption: all waves require a medium. Sound travels through air and ocean waves through water. It stood to reason, then, that light must travel through an invisible, all-pervading substance called the "luminiferous aether."[^1] This idea was a cornerstone of physics, a necessary explanation for how light could traverse the vacuum of space. To question the aether was to question the very logic of the era.

Then, in 1865, James Clerk Maxwell made an audacious intellectual move. He ignored the aether entirely. Instead of trying to define its physical properties, he proposed a radical new assumption: at every point in the universe—from the vastness of empty space to the air we breathe and the gaps between atoms—there exists an invisible electromagnetic field.[^2]

This was a philosophical earthquake. Maxwell proposed that electricity and magnetism were two aspects of this single, unified field. A disturbance in one would create a disturbance in the other, resulting in a self-propagating ripple that needed no medium, for the field *was* its own medium.

The proof was in the mathematics. When Maxwell calculated the speed of this ripple using two experimentally established constants of nature—the permittivity (ε₀) and permeability (μ₀) of free space—the result was precisely the known speed of light.[^3]

This created a profound contradiction. The aether theory demanded that the speed of light be relative; an observer moving toward a light source should measure a faster speed. But Maxwell's equations predicted a single, absolute speed for light, derived from universal constants that do not change. The observer's motion was irrelevant.

This new assumption, and the mathematics it produced, not only shattered the idea of the aether but also challenged the foundations of Newtonian physics. The aether was banished not by a direct experiment to find it, but by a single, magnificent, and daring thought. Maxwell's true legacy was the boldness of his assumption. He dared to imagine that the universe was not empty but filled with an invisible, active, and infinite field. This paved the way for Einstein, who would again revolutionize our understanding of reality by uniting space and time.

> **"Theory of Relativity"** - What is in the name?
>
> If the constancy of light's speed is central, why did Einstein name his work the "Theory of Relativity"? The name is admittedly confusing. It doesn’t imply that the speed of light is relative. On the contrary, the theory is built on the principle that the speed of light is the only universal absolute.
>
> Einstein's theory is named "Relativity" because, to protect the constancy of the speed of light, something else had to give. What gave way were our common-sense notions of space and time. The theory revealed that measurements of mass, time, distance, and even simultaneity are not absolute but are, in fact, *relative* to the observer's motion.[^4] Time can slow down, and lengths can contract, depending on one's speed.
>
> So, the theory is called Relativity because it uncovers the relative nature of space and time—a profound insight forced upon us by the absolute, unchanging speed of light.

The core takeaway from Maxwell and Einstein is that the reality we perceive in mass, space, and time is relative—it is emergent. The only constant is the underlying field. Science cannot explain where this field came from or who created it, but that hasn't stopped us from embracing the concept of "fields." In fact, modern science has largely abandoned our perceived reality as fundamental, convinced that it emerges from underlying, unknowable fields.

## A Different Starting Point: Consciousness as the Field

Maxwell's field was just the beginning. Modern physics, with quantum field theory, now proposes at least **seventeen** fundamental fields—one for electrons, another for photons (light), and so on for every elementary particle.[^5] The model is called the "standard model" because there is a majority consensus from both a theoretical and experimental standpoint. While this is incredibly powerful, it raises a few questions: Are we, like the nineteenth-century scientists with their aether, trying to explain everything through a complex system of "many fields"? Are we doing to the idea of "Maxwell's field" what our predecessors did with the "aether," albeit with better mathematics and experimental plumbing?

Perhaps our assumption of reality is as flawed as the idea of the aether was in Maxwell's time.

> What if quantum fields are an emergent property of something even more fundamental? What if we are trying to understand the underlying code by breaking the computer screen into ever smaller pixels—the elementary particles? This intelligence is extremely useful from a material science perspective, but the clues to the origin (and dissolution) of life may lie elsewhere. In essence, modern physics may have lost its core directional pursuit. Instead of attempting to answer the question of creation, it has limited itself to explaining the elements of a virtual reality.

Vedic science offers a different starting point. It postulates that the fundamental field is **consciousness**—an equilibrium state of three esoteric qualities: *Sattva*, *Rajas*, and *Tamas*.[^6] These qualities, like consciousness itself, are not physical, but we feel them just as we feel the life within us. A ripple in this underlying Vedic field creates superintelligence (*`Mahat`*), which literally means "the greatest intelligence." *Mahat* in turn gives rise to localized identities. Identity (`Ahamkara`) develops senses (`Indriyas`), and the senses then construct the physical world (`Panchbhoota`) we perceive.[^7]

In the Vedic view, our world is a form of virtual reality generated by consciousness. But here is a crucial difference: this virtual reality is created from the **inside out**, not from the outside in, as we experience with conventional VR. We don't jump into the Vedic VR; we create it around us. This might sound similar to modern simulation theory, where the world is likened to a computer screen that appears when we open our eyes. Quite the opposite, in the Vedic view, the emergent reality is not a simulation. It is as real as in the scientific view—whether the classical Maxwell-Einstein model or the modern quantized approach. But it emerges from an underlying intelligence. This also doesn't mean it is an "intelligent design"; in the Vedic view, the "intelligent design" is chaos. Chance is the fundamental intelligence.

> The key difference lies in the foundational assumption. Modern science assumes consciousness emerges from a deterministic physical substrate like classical computers. Vedic science posits the opposite: the fundamental field *is* indeterminate consciousness, and everything else, including the real (and chaotic quantum) physical world, arises from it.

Vedic view strongly supports Darwinian evolution, though the evolutionary purpose is not mere survival—it is the rise of "intelligence." Conscious beings are continuously evolving into better configurations to improve their purpose-fit intelligence. An improvement in intelligence leads to a better identity—the ultimate goal being to identify with the creator. Similarly, the Vedic model accounts for individual agency and interaction between conscious beings, each an emergent property of a universal field of consciousness—the divine. Our intelligence is like ripples in this field, interacting with infinite other ripples. It is not a single-player game.

## The Gita's Framework: The Hypothesis of Inner Knowledge

The power of Vedic assumptions is central to the Gita. Just as Maxwell assumed a universal field to explain the progression of light, the Gita proposes an underlying divine field for the progression of consciousness. The way we understand Maxwell's field through the constancy of the speed of light, we can understand the Vedic field through its effects—our own intelligence.

The Gita's framework is simple and intuitive. It hypothesizes that an element of consciousness resides in all of us. Krishna called it `Atma`—"the Self."[^8] It is our own copy of complete and unaltered knowledge, seeded deep within us. This idea posits that a ripple in the underlying field of three forces—Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas—captures a piece of consciousness and binds it to the physical. The physical body itself is then created by this tiny spark of consciousness, much like a tiny seed in a mother's womb becomes a 2,000-pound gorilla. While learning about the physical world is important, the key purpose of intelligence is to understand who we are. That is a better directional alignment with the very purpose of science because the world around us is the way we perceive it. A fish, for instance, likely perceives water with the same sense of solid reality that we attribute to land. What you perceive as green, I may perceive as red, yet we both agree to call it "green" because that is our common agreement. Trying to decipher the world around us is an inferior, if not futile, purpose before we progress on the path of understanding our own conscious being.

This idea was beyond imagination just a couple of centuries ago, so it was often wrapped in belief systems. Today, however, we are accustomed to scientific ideas that defy intuition, like quantum mechanics, relativity, and computing. Science has proved that our sensory apparatus is limited. With this understanding, we can explore the possibility that there may be more to our physical reality than what our senses report.

The Gita proposes a distributed model of consciousness that is protected, immutable, and encrypted. A full copy of consciousness, `Atma`, is pre-built into every conscious agent, or `Jeeva`. When we say a full copy, think of a wave in the ocean. A wave has as much "knowledge" of the properties of water as the entire ocean. In essence, a full copy doesn't mean the entirety of the substance, but the entirety of the knowledge. **That is why you may see the words `Atma` and knowledge used interchangeably in this text.**

It is important to lay out the difference between knowledge and intelligence. Intelligence is a faculty of knowledge that standardizes communication between two or more conscious beings. Our ability to work together depends on our ability to reach common standards and hence our intelligence. In a way, intelligence is a wrapper to convey messages. Messages are perceived by knowledge. Everyone responds differently to signals thus received. Intelligence is all about reducing ambiguity. For example, in our languages, colors are very well defined. Everyone means the same shade of color when we say the word "Blue." There is no ambiguity from the communication standpoint, yet everyone still perceives blue differently. In many instances, where things are not yet fully defined, it is hard to communicate intelligently. For example, abstract things like love are not well defined. The meaning gets distorted in communication itself—even within the same language. Thus, the extent of intelligence is largely related to information communication and hence the language. But all communication is merely a signal to knowledge. We can ask people to drive from city A to B, but everyone drives differently. Even if you standardize the car, year, make, model, and color—still, the driving style is different. Driving style comes from knowledge. In other words, knowledge is the extent of decryption of our internal full copy of consciousness.

The Gita's idea of `Atma`—that conscious element that is the basis of this body and hence the expanse of this universe—pertains to a complete body of knowledge in super condensed encrypted form. What we are capable of understanding is the extent to which we decrypt this knowledge—a small portion of this complete copy. And then within that very small decrypted portion, there is an even smaller subset that we standardize and communicate with other conscious beings—that super-tiny subset is called intelligence. For example, I can't communicate how my own heart is pumping at this moment. Most of our automated body functions are part of our decrypted consciousness—knowledge, but they are beyond communication—intelligence. We have decrypted how to breathe—which is why we can do it—but we cannot communicate the process. Even trivial creative pursuits such as writing, singing, or even coding—they are all there because we have decrypted the knowledge individually, but no one can communicate how the creative process works within. Creativity is beyond mere intelligence. Vast is our knowledge, yet in contrast to the entirety of encrypted knowledge that the conscious seed within us represents, it is very small.

### Protected and Immutable

This consciousness cannot be destroyed by physical means. As Krishna says, weapons cannot cut it, fire cannot burn it, and water cannot wet it. It exists beyond the physical realm. This knowledge is also `Akshara`, a Sanskrit word meaning "that which does not decay with time."[^9] In other words, it is not only beyond the physical but also beyond the notion of time.

### Encrypted but Knowable

This consciousness is not easily perceived by our externally focused senses (and mind), which are designed for evolution (enhancement of intelligence). The truth, therefore, appears encrypted, or `Avyakta`.[^10] This encryption is not a permanent barrier but an incentivized push to engage us with the physical world, for it is this external world that holds the key to our inner knowledge. Think of reality as the public key and the consciousness as the private key of a cryptographic key pair.

Since everyone's circumstances are unique, each of us has a unique set of "cryptographic keys." The method to decrypt the underlying truth is necessarily individual. "Encrypted" does not mean "impossible"; it means we need the right key. Once we have it, the entire knowledge base becomes self-evident. The "game" of discovery exists because the experience is beautiful. Our physical reality is crafted by our own intelligence. Its immersive nature is meant to be addictive, because only through complete submersion do we understand the nature of the divine.

### The Ultimate Knowledge

The Gita claims this inner consciousness is all we need to know. It is **worth knowing** because the answers to life's great questions—chief among them, "Who are we?"—are already within us. Our external quests are ultimately a search for ourselves.

It is **knowable** because it is built into us; it is `Atma`, "the Self." Our physical body and mind are tools for action. To let this beautiful apparatus go without decrypting the knowledge within is a wasted opportunity.

### The Knowledge Network

If the path is individual, are we alone? No. The decrypted knowledge manifests as everything we perceive. Our individual decryption leads to skills that manifest things in the world. The collective decrypted knowledge of all beings is what the Gita refers to as `Brahma`.[^11] Our physical world is actually created by us. It is NOT a figment of our imagination, as many new simulation theories posit. In Vedic science, and consequently in the Gita's framework, our world is collectively created by us—inside out—one step at a time. And we are also agents of its dissolution. In essence, this perpetual physical world has no beginning or end. Questions pertaining to its beginning and end are fundamentally questions related to the limitations of our perception of time. As Einstein showed, time is relative, not fundamental, so the whole focus on the boundary conditions of time is essentially a curveball to keep lesser intelligence confused.

Our collective creation serves a purpose. In Vedic traditions, `Brahma` is the entirety of the system, the overarching reality that provisions everything we need for our life's experiments. It also gives us the challenges we need to solve based on our unique circumstances. In essence, this collective decrypted knowledge gives us our purpose. As Krishna says in Chapter 3, Verse 15, righteous actions (`Karma`) are born from `Brahma`, and `Brahma` is born from `Akshara` (the immutable knowledge). He concludes:

> *"Therefore, the all-pervading `Brahma` is eternally situated in the ritual of action (`Yajna`)."*[^12]

## A Balanced Path

For the last century, physicists have sought a "Theory of Everything" to unify relativity and quantum mechanics. A true theory of everything, however, must also account for consciousness. On the other hand, some philosophies devalue our sensory reality, claiming it is merely a projection of our minds.

The Gita establishes a balance. It affirms that we must have the deepest appreciation for our physical reality because it is what holds the keys to our inner knowledge. The Gita rejects asceticism for its own sake and insists that we cannot achieve a state of inaction without first performing action.

The Gita provides a framework for both our scientific and spiritual quests. It offers a theory not just for the cosmos, but for us. It provides a path to live better, act righteously, and find peace. This message is more relevant than ever in a world of exponential technological opportunity and immense human suffering. There has never been a greater need for humanity to choose right from wrong and stay focused on the path.

## Where is the proof?

The Vedic point of view is intuitively appealing, but where is the proof? Maxwell showed the proof in math. Particle physicists must observe the particles before claiming a victory, but how do we prove consciousness?

By definition, since our intelligence, knowledge, and consciousness exist within our own subjective bubble, it is impossible to perceive them directly with our senses. The only option is to transcend our limited reality and see the collective view. This collective knowledge is what Vedic science refers to as `Bramh`. The proof is in `Bramh`.

If we look at our collective intelligence, we find a striking similarity. The Vedic view of creation is closer to modern AI models. What we have discovered in artificial intelligence is our collective intelligence. The sum of our collective intelligence in AI is far greater than our individual, isolated intelligence.

It is quite obvious that our AI will lead to superintelligence, and superintelligence will power robots. Robots will have sensors. These sensors shall help them perceive the world in a totally different fashion than us.

Imagine a post-AGI hybrid world: each robot, endowed with a tiny subset of superintelligence, develops its own perception tools and interacts with others, including us. Their senses are attuned to their tasks, and their perception of the universe is vastly different from ours. From the robot's standpoint, the physical world was already there; they just developed a new vantage point from which to view it. They wouldn't necessarily create a new world of their own; the economic model mandates that they augment existing reality. They will enhance our world through a totally different perception, just as every biological species enhances the world with its own perspective of reality.

We can see this in nature. Dogs sense and perceive the world very differently than we do. Butterflies develop sensors based on what they need to survive and thrive. Their perception of reality is vastly different, yet always evolving. It is hard to fathom that we are any different, or that the robots AI would make are going to be any different.

In essence, the collective view of `Bramh` proves to us that evolution is nothing but layers of reality unfolding. Each underlying layer is seen as knowledge; it breeds intelligence that leads to physical beings and their own perspective of collective reality. Through evolution, when the outermost layer decrypts enough knowledge, it creates a new layer—first a massive intelligence cloud, followed by physical bodies, their sensors, and their own perception.

Layer by layer, knowledge and intelligence are stacked over each other. This entire infinite stack of intelligence and knowledge represents consciousness. The consciousness is the all-encompassing `Bramh`—pulsating, evolving, expanding, and enhancing. It is ever-present because time itself is just one aspect of this conscious manifestation.

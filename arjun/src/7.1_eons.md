In chapter of conciouness we understood the nature of consious agent. It has all the necessry scaffolding that is needed to pursue the knowledge and it has all the bugs to indulge with the matrix with senses developed to engage. The question arises how such a complex agent is formed. After all we are quite a complex machine. In the user interface we look like a human body with skin on the top and bones to form the skeleton but are we a single mesh of consciousness or are we spread across ?

Arguably , consious agent is also made of number os machines. Trillions of very complex machines. Each holding a piece of decryted knowlede. If you think of conciousness as an immense field of mesh where matrix binds the knowledge for each manifestation , each machine and concious agents then we are not a single mesh. We are spread over a vast area ouselves. When we awaken - arguably all the area in our control lights up. When we darken a vast area darkens. 

And imagine a mesh of trillions of concious agents.. What is with in us is also spread all around in all the directions. The construct remains the same. The spread can be as big as you can imagine, or as small as you want to think. 

The idea is as an awakened conscious agent, if you perceive all the mesh lighted up around you, it is one state ; if you see darkness all around , it is another state. Both these states represent where duality ends. These are the beginnings or ends of eons. 

# Kalpa

Such change of state , from one extreme to another is marked by a `Yuga` - Eon. You can think of this as `Yajna` of entire universe as a single concious entity. Kalpa is a cicle. There is no start or end. Just the different states of decryption of knowledge or rise of the matrix.

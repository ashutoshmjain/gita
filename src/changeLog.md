# changeLog [^history]

## July 1, 23

- [Mathura](./mathuraLanding.md)
  - [Naive](./mathuraChap06.md) - General Edits. Created sections. 
  - [Resolution](./mathuraChap07.md) - Added the introduction paras. General edits and sections 


## June 23, 23

Restored the Mahabharata landing page. It seems the page was deleted with other Mahabharata files.
Moved the development work to Android. Samsung Galaxy tab S7 FE. The terminal experience on Android has improved a lot with Termux though the sad part is Google has removed Termux from the app store. Needed to install F Droid to get the terminal going. Tried out installing Debian Andronix as well as with userLand but all I needed was old and time tested Termux with a Zook bluetooth Fingerpad.
- [Mathura](./mathuraLanding.md)
  - [Island](./mathuraChap05.md) - General Edits. Reshaped the introduction to meet with the content.
  - [Naive](./mathuraChap06.md) - General Edits. Reshaped introduction and added a footnote.

## June 16, 23

Trying to get a hold of the narrative after a month long gap due to my daughter's wedding (which was fun and prolly lot more important than this:-)

In addition to general edits, got a third person view of these chapters when I started reading them again after a gap. Some of the changes I made were only possible if I emptied out my cache memory. A writer must take a break and read his work again so as to see things purely from a reader's persepective. Hope these chapters would make better sense now !

### research and notes:
----

[^history]: Knowledge is deep understanding of the history. Be it a project, a book or a product. The final copy (with a small training manual) is mere manifestation of the knowledge. The knowledge is encrypted with in that final shape as the history of all the changes - of the ideas, of the code or the people.  For example, what you are reading is just an online document, the histoy of this book is in the thousands of commits on the github. The knowledge is "encrypted" because there is no way to document the rationale of all the changes that go into creation of the final shape. Even if someone document all the changes, it is almost impossible to read, understand and appreciate the sequential changes. The iterative actions to reach a final shape is `Karma`. In essence knowledge gets encrypted in `Karma` or in other words `Karma` is what leads to manifestation hiding (or binding) the knowledge to a final shape. What we get from the "manifested" product is only "information". Information may inspire or distract but it is not knowledge. Thus even after reading a book or even after using a product, the consumer only gets the information. Knowledge needs close association or active participation in the process of creation.A "changelog" is thus the starting point for "knowledge" seekers.

[^open]: "Open" is kinda misnomer because best way to hide something is to keep it in the open :-)

---

[^edits]:  "general edits" means I reviewed the full page and made changes to the text and flow. These could be small changes , additions of few lines or rearranging the text for better readability.

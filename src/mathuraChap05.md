A day has no meaning without a night. A river must have two banks. A computer has a binary "0" and a "1" at its core. Even a narrative manifests amidst the story of a hero and a villain. Science (`Vinyan`)is the study of the dualities - to put them to a greater use. Every time we get a better appreciation of a duality, we expound a new branch of science. For example Chemistry is built on the idea of "charge" duality. Particle physics is an outcome of magnetic duality (also called spin). The digital duality (0 and 1) is the basis for the computer science. Our own body is a mirror image as if two halves are sealed together - one on left and another on the right - two hands, two legs, two ears. Even the brains are split into left and right halves. Not only anatomy, every thought has a dualistic outlook - a yes or a no - to be or not to be!

It is now scientifically proven that "duality" is the fundamental nature of our universe, but duality is essentially a reflection of something more potent - held within. Isn't it?

 What is that "one" that sits with in dipoles of a magnet? What exactly is that "unseen" that runs between an anode and a cathode ? Spirituality (`Nyaan`), is the careful study of that "one" staying put amidst the duality. This "one", as per practitioners of spirituality, is the only real "element" - `Tattva` - the most elementary particle. Rest everything is just an expression of `Tattva` on account of complex wrinkles of infinite dualities. Since it is the study of "one", there are obviously no branches of `Spirituality`. It is simply knowing "who am I?".

The written and the spoken words are two different reflections of the same word - they both carry the same meaning, though a "word" has no physical existence unless it is spoken or written down? Likewise all dualities are reflections of a "single truth" hidden from sensory observations. It exists and yet it remains inseparable from the multitude of dualities it reflects ! 

One may see duality as the motherly cradle - others may see it simply as a propensity of manifestation, but none may argue it's multi-dimensional omnipresence. In particle physics, duality is called "Parity Symmetry", In `Vaidik` science, the faction that upholds "duality" as the only truth is known as `Dwait` - dualism.  `Dwait` believes that the "manifested" is nothing but the complex knots of many dualities in many dimensions.  The "creation" is infinite manifestations of these knots (`Karm Bandhana`). It, thus, says that the liberation is all about gradual untying of these knots. The process of untying the knots of duality is called `Karm-kshya` - sacrificing the `Karmas` (that led to these knots in the first place) i.e. renunciation - weeding out dualities!

Since duality is fundamental, even "dualism" must have it's own reflection. This reflection is called `Adwait` - non-dualism. It underscores the nature, shape and the existence of that "perpetual"  that dualities bind with in? It says, that `Avykta` (inexpressible knowledge) that dualities bind, is just "one" - an island amidst the banks of a river. They all appears different to senses because of differing nature of the binding dualities. It believes that "knowledge" binds itself into the knots (of evolving dualities) to gain access to just one question - who am I?  What is my own true shape (`Swa-roopa`). If one could know the answer to this question, dualities automatically vanish because they are rendered unnecessary.

`Adwait` thus is the unyielding faith in singular underlying field, and a conscious ignorance of dualities as mere emergent sensory distractions. The singular truth is the thing that manifests amidst innumerable knotted dualities. Unlike the ideas of Quantum Mechanics, the "manifest" is neither a "given" nor an accident - it takes "knowledge" and repetitive actions (`Karma`) to fructify one observable "truth". An "island" is thus the truth of a river's labour as much as a narrative is a writers vociferous flow over dualities of the plot. This process of  manifestation and it's continuous evolution, as per `Adwait`, is `Karma` - the modus operandi of `Vishnu`. And the conciousness that evolves (to seek the answer to the profound question) is `Vishnu` itself.

 `Maharishi Parāśara` was a believer of `Adwait`. He worshipped `Vishnu` as the manifestative potency and the as the oppressor of all dualities (`Hari`). He believed in the manifest - the island - though he understood well that the "visible" was a complex cryptographic image of infinite dualities and almost impossible to decrypt. And he believed that the answer to his quest rested hidden, metaphorically, in the center of the two "never-meeting" banks. But it would  take another generation to fully understand the depth of the question "who am I" and to suggest a definitive path to it's solution. It would take incarnation of `Vishnu` himself to explain the mysterious birth of an island.

 In `Sanskrit`, an island is called a `Dweep`. And  the one who is born out of a `Dweep` is called `Dwaipayana`. A name that was already there in `Maharishi's` mind for his son. Who knew immortal `Dwaipayana` would actually take birth on a haunted island ...

# `Dweep` ..

`Matsyagandha` was daughter of a poor fisherman who passed away when she turned eleven, not that anyone was counting. Her mother had already died in the labor of her birth. No one wanted to be with her for she was labeled bad omen. 

Poor girl knew only one way to survive this world — ferry people across `Yamuna` — the mighty river, by the abode (`Ashrama`) of `Maharishi Parāśara`. Her only possession was her father's dilapidated boat. The cruelty of her fate — no one wanted to ride with her. Not only the boat was in bad shape, she herself had a pungent smell; thus the name `Matsyagandha` that literally meant one who smelled like a fish (`Matsya` in Sanskrit, means a fish, and `Gandha` means fragrance). 

No one had ever trained `Matsya` on "how to make-up", or present herself. Absolutely no training in hospitality. She used to get 'stuck and stranded' commuters when no other boats were around, normally early mornings or late evenings. And she hated it for she was scared of `Yamuna` in windy mornings as much as in the invisible dark nights. Many times she thought of letting her boat to the deep waters, but even death wouldn't come easy to her. No one in the village spoke to her. She had no friends. No one would care to notice if she was lost from the face of Earth. 

The solitude of lone purposeless life made `Matsyagandha` spend most her time with herself, and her imagination. Back at her broken hut, she used to gaze the stars through the holes in her thatched roof. She had no formal education, yet, she honed curiosity of a writer and creativity of a poet, just by talking to herself and the waves of `Yamuna` — and the stars. And she didn't even know it. Her world had no bridge to the scriptures and none at all to the ongoing tussle between spoken word and the written text.

`Maharishi Parāśara` had taken her boat once, when he wanted to spend a dark night on the island middle of the mile wide `Yamuna`.

It had be an understatement to call it a simple island. It was a cursed jungle where no men wanted to go. Fishermen wanted their boats at least half a mile from the haunted space. 

Only `Matsyagandha` would take `Maharishi` to the island for she had no passenger in days. `Maharishi` was impressed with her courage though he didn't quite get the reason — she was short on basic supplies such as rice and milk. For many days, she was living on raw uncooked wild berries. And she herself was curious of the island. Many times she had thought of checking the place out, to see the demons. What worse could they be then her own fate!

As `Maharishi's` alighted the boat, `Matsya` felt his magical presence. She felt safe. And free, at the same time, as if no one was watching her. Neither pity nor lust. No one bothered by the state of her boat and even less of the stink she was oozing. As if he was totally disconnected from the pain of this world - her world ; yet so profoundly present. `Maharishi` was lost in his thoughts, his eyes gazing the setting sun and then the tall ghostly trees of the island. She wondered what he was thinking — her world and his, so close yet so different. 

The ride to the island was slightly downstream and the wind was favoring the back. `Maharishi` sat on the rear end of the boat. `Matsya` stood in the middle with nothing much to do except adjust the aging sails. In between she kept an eye on the passengers though today there was only one. He too, totally lost in himself. His mind sifting through random thoughts — from ancient history to the current state of affairs, and circling back. He recalled the stories of `Ramayana` that his grand father `Maharishi Vaśiṣṭha` told him growing up ; and that how uncomplicated the life was, back then... 

In those ancient times leading up to days of `Vaśiṣṭha`, there was only one definition of truth, and rest everything was false. As the boat took to the waters, his thoughts took on the rhythm of the waves. 

Life has gotten so complex these days — he thought. 

Back then, if there was a conflict, scriptures were deemed as the final arbitrator. `Maharishi Valmiki` had defined ‘righteous’ in his epic `Ramayana`. It became the reference code of conduct. The narrative covered every aspect of a noble king's life `Rama`, and as the kings adopted good lifestyle, the realm automatically fell in line. People believed in their leaders and the leaders treated citizens more than their own offspring. However, too much was hinged on the righteous behavior of the king. 

The problem was every king couldn't be a `Rama`. `Kalmashapada`, who killed his father also called himself a king. The current real king of the vast empire across `Yamuna` was `Shantanu`. He was a great administrator, but he was no `Rama` and he had lot more (complex) people to manage - for populations were growing faster than anyone could plan for. As we started living in villages (and cities), safe from the predators, humans multiplied at a much faster rate. This increased population and availability of more free time per capita, led to a virtuous cycle of agriculture, mining and metallurgy - each feeding on other. But still, there were more mouths to be fed. And hungry mouths always chatted bad of the king while praising the old leaders. A miserable present always made people hopeless for the future, and also made them sing glories of the past. Which meant they started living in the past instead of working on the "present" for a brighter future. And , there were many who thought this innovation led cycle of growth was utterly unsustainable. They wanted back the time tested rules of jungle!

`Maharishi's` train of thoughts was broken by a soft but confident female voice. `Matsyagandha` was announcing the arrival. She was asking `Maharishi` to hold the boat tight while she jumped in the waters to pull the boat towards sandy beach, for there was no formal dock out there - not even a jetty. 

`Maharishi` found her voice rather noticeable. It was a voice he had expect from a `Naad Yogi` with many years of active recital in her back pocket. He let this thought go off  — maybe she had naturally practiced this announcement thousands of time since childhood! You have probably heard such confident voice when a air hostess announces landing of your plane. They sound even more confident than the captain of the aircraft. That is the power of practice. `Naad Yogies` sounded more confident than the writer of the scripture they were reciting! And that was one reason they could influence the powerful and also amass a cult of followers.

As `Maharishi` got off the boat, he thanked `Matsya`. He gave her a silver coin. `Matsya` had never seen a silver coin before. Some passenger gave her a copper, though most skipped the line throwing fruits or grain in a wooden bucket tied to the hull. There was no fixed fare. On a good day, she could earn a week's ration though "good days" were rather rare in hot tropical rainy season — that was just ending with onset of pleasant Autumn. She was so happy (on the silver bounty) that she offered to wait for `Maharishi` for the ride back home, even though the lengthening shadows of the tall trees were covering her sails. Soon it had be dark and the wind was already making circles around her tiny boat.

I am staying here for the night, but if you are free please come back tomorrow morning at sun rise. I will be very thankful — said `Maharishi` — as courteous to her as he would be to a king.

`Matsya` bowed to `Maharishi` as a gesture of respect and promised to pick him up next daybreak. On her way back, she wondered how could someone go to a haunted island without any exit plans! Then she realized he was a `Yogi`. He lived in the present. Or perhaps, he had other plans!  But if he did, then why would he ask her to come back! She left the mystery unresolved as the pangs of hunger took over her mind. And she was looking for a good meal tonight. She had a silver in her hand! She would probably never realize that `Maharishi` knew she would offer help, if he gave her a silver coin! If she didn't, then obviously he  missed making a just payment.

`Maharishi` was looking forward to this night at the quiet island, away from the responsibilities of running a congregation. A night for thinking. He wanted to focus on thoughts that were always pushed to the back, for the daily chores took precedence. Island was not unfamiliar to `Maharishi`. He knew a cave very close to the beach, nestled between number of tall `palm` trees , as if inviting those "who know"; but well hidden among lesser tall `Ashokas` to keep it safe from wanderers and animals alike.

After cleaning up the cave, he took a dip in `Yamuna`, and ate couple of seasonal fruits he had brought with him — just enough to sustain a night. Having nourished himself, he lit up a small fire and sat on a flat stone. His thoughts now more focused. As if, he was talking to himself. Soon his breath slowed down. His eyes half closed. No one could tell if he was awake or asleep. He transcended into a `Samadhi`. His thoughts played in his eyes like a virtual reality. His mind busy in capturing the 'clarity' and saving it into his memory.

With the improvement in spoken layer — ability to better articulate complex ideas verbally — the first major innovation humans did to themselves — they learnt to put forth ‘wrong verses right’ from their point of view. This was a big leap forward. In essence, definition of wrong verse right became personal rather than being universal. This personalization was a pre-requisite for building a community of followers in `Bhakti Yoga`, but there was a big basic problem  — he thought.

How to ascertain whose vantage was the correct representation of truth? For example, a blacksmith deemed deity of fire as the most worthy for fire could melt the metals. On the other side, a farmer thought deity of water was most potent for water was the source of food. Farming needed a dedicated community of followers as much as forging the metal. Both of them trying to sell their point of view as the singular truth to seek blind dedication in their community. It worked fine internally, but they had a difficult situation when put in front of each other in the local tavern!

Blacksmith argued how would a farmer cultivate without the tools (of agriculture) that were cast in Fire. Even the king needed swords to protect the state — all made available by the deity of Fire. Farmer had a better argument! Fire was a demon for it burnt the dry forests. And most importantly, water had the power to put the fire off. Only rain could save the holy Banyan trees from forest fires. Blacksmith rebutted saying even food needed to be cooked in THE Fire. ..... A silent potter thought, both of them were wrong for the true deity was mother Earth that he used to make all the utensils and on which were played the songs of fire and ice... And so on ... No one ready to downplay their deities, or even trivial ideas.

Even the scriptures could be seen differently from different vantage points. This meant humans must debate to prove their point. It was as if humanity had entered into a real life ‘twitter-verse’ except that there could be dire consequences — lot harsher than just getting your account locked ! Losing a scuffle was degrading. People could be barred from the community or forced to leave a village. Sometimes they would take on life threatening pledges — say sacrifice a limb to prove integrity of their ideas. Sometimes, they could be asked to walk through (holy) fire to confirm their purity (not being driven by vested interest). People were finding it exciting to organize and express a ‘thought framework’, but ‘freedom of speech’ was still not a social contract .... Yet there were many outspoken.

`Maharishi` attributed this verbosity to a vicious underlying cycle. He called it ‘curse of feedback’. It became more important how others reacted to one's point of view — a natural incentive for those who could better express themselves verbally. He attributed this curse to the rise of chanters and reciters. It was somewhat like blaming the social-influencers for the ill effects of Instagram, probably because there was no corporation to blame for holding the mirror to tacitly evolving complexity of human thought!

Official debates (`Shastratha` — a formal discussion on interpretation of scriptures) were organized in kings' open courts, on topics as varied as economy to spirituality. For example, to authorize state aggression to tax the neighboring states `Ashwamedha Yazna`? And even to jury the baseless ‘perceived’ acts of treason for kings were generally insecure. Existence of singular God v/s many deities was another interesting topic of recurring discussion. Without a written down statute, the decision could be easily swayed in favour of the powerful. A situation could be justified through many conflicting explanations. “Plurality of views” was touted the primary differentiator from other species but we hadn't yet developed tools to internalize “plurality”. 

Most animals had a “canned” behavior — a standard response to a specific situation — no conflicts — no debate. Humans could discuss the righteous action plan. The stated objective of debates was to drive consensus but reality was different. A defeat in arguments was as painful as a loss in a physical dual, and the consequences could be even harsher. `Maharishi` wondered if this cycle could ever be broken? Where would it end? — because in his mind, it was causing more harm than good! People were losing trust. Human spirit was falling apart. At the same time, he didn't want humanity to return to the stone ages to live (and physically fight) like animals. How to determine the right path?


Beneath this confusion, a subtle change occurred in society — an unintended consequence. People were now more worried about the reaction of others. As we started spending more time in sharpening and better expressing our world view, we forgot what we ourselves wanted to do — our inner calling. We were losing our soul (`Atma`). Our focus shifted from actions that we did for our inner sake to the ones that were appreciated (or approved) by the community. We started living for the approval of the family, the race and the religion. And at most times, bringing these three core groups together was impossible. Family values conflicted with those of the race and race was at loggerheads with religion or vice versa. The definition of “righteous” became the approval of entire community and that narrowed down the action field. You must not do anything that is not in line with family values, and race, and religion — in that order. The “self” was lost. Compliance became more important than the actions. How you were perceived by other verses who you actually were!

Those were the challenges for `Maharishi Parāśara` and he wondered if one lifetime was enough to save the society on this slippery slope. Or he needed someone to carry on his journey to the finish line — may be a “think-alike” son who shared the same discovery path. Someone, who could find the true answer leveraging the work of his ancestors, and also manifest the change on the coattails of generational shift. What better could a 'man with a mission' ask? — a son who could take on the work he started.

He must have slept well past midnight, for next day, when he woke up, sun was about to rise. Fire had settled into a slow rising sliver of smoke. Though in a hurry, he still noticed, some of the big Palm leaves had fallen over the smoke. He wondered if Palms too shed their leaves in autumn! Nevertheless, he noticed that the leaves appeared hardened and their color much lighter shade of green. Curious, he picked up a large leaf and folded it over. It wasn't brittle. He decided to take the leaf with him to see if it could be used for writing.

Sleep after a `Samadhi` always turned up concrete answers for him. After quick run through of morning routines, he rushed to the place where `Matsya` had dropped him. He was pleased to see her waiting there for him. She looked lot happier this morning. `Maharishi` didn't realize she ate a full meal last evening after many nights of deprivation. And she had planned to ask `Maharishi` about her future. She had heard `Maharishi` was an astrologer.

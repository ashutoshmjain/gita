# `Katha Ananta` - an infinite narrative

> Hari Anant, Hari Katha Ananta |
>
> Kahahin Sunahi,  Bahu Bidhi Sab Santa ||

In `Bal Kanda`, the first book of `Ramcharit Mansa`, adaptation of `Valmiki's` epic `Ramayana`, from `Sanskrit` to  vernacular `Avadhi`, revered saint and poet `Tulsidasa` wrote ...

> `Hari` is infinite, and his narratives are endless. 
>
>  His stories are spoken, and relished by all saints — in numerous forms, and even more styles. 

The question for unobservant me was —  why, and who exactly is `Hari`? . The [Sanskritdictionary.com](https://sanskritdictionary.com) was few clicks away, to fulfill my quest ..

> <sup> Hari (हरि ) [Definition](https://sanskritdictionary.com/hari/279877/1) : m. (especially) Name of viṣṇu-kṛṣṇa- (in this sense thought by some to be derived from hṛ-,"to take away or remove evil or sin")  etc. </sup>

The definition, led me to a deeper dwelling...

`Hari` means the one who removes darkness, and obstacles. `Hari` may act as divinity — a discrete person — or another finite form of manifestation such as an animal, or a tool or a machine — or simply in a probabilistic fashion — a chance. In `Rig Veda`, `Hari` is considered the first of all divine forces —  a synonym for `Vishnu`. 

All that was good! We all claim to know the "essence" of God, but the question remained — why existence of such a force? If there exist a force for good, then there must be a force for evil too. And who gets to decide what is good and what is evil? Is it only for humans ? What about animals ? Even more, what about non living - the basic building blocks of life such as proteins or sub atomic particles? After all we all are made of Fermions and held together by Bosons. Do they have any sense of good v/s bad !

As the poet said, `Hari` has infinite narratives. One such, that interested me more (than others) and, presented a different  perspective, and kinda put an end to "good v/s evil" debate  was — `Vishnu`, through his incarnations , takes consciousness to ever higher levels. In essence, it is not `Vishnu` that decides good v/s bad - s/he enables the decision. From `Matsyavtara` to `Krsna`, `Vishnu's` incarnations kick-start a progression in consciousness. And it goes long before humans put their feet on mother earth ..

This interpretation was first put forward by the `Gaudiya Vaishnava saint Bhaktivinoda Thakura`, long time back,  in his 1873 book `Datta-kaustubha`, and again in his 1880 book `Kṛṣṇa-saṁhita`. The time of his publication, incidently, appears to match the publication of Darwin's theory (1859). I got curious for one more reason — it appeared that attempts to bridge the gaps in  scientific reckonings and spiritual pursuits , isn't new ! We are all chasing for a "theory of everything ! from ever ..

<sup> Theosophist Helena Blavatsky also reiterated this in her 1877 opus [Isis Unveiled](https://selfdefinition.org/blavatsky/H.P.Blavatsky-Isis-Unveiled-vol-2.pdf). Blavatsky believed that the avatara-related Hindu texts were an allegorical presentation of Darwinian evolution. </sup>

The ten incarnations of `Hari`, described as "full incarnations" above, are thus, major evolutionary milestones. Scriptures and culture is full of their narratives. That, however, is not all, there are countless other narratives representing minor milestones in our journey to a civilized way of life. These minor milestones are called "perfections" of `Vishnu` — `Vibhooties`. 

When asked by `Arjuna` to describe himself, in chapter ten of `Bhagvad Gita`, `Krsna` expressed himself through his `Vibhooties` — I am the "force of creation" in all such endeavours that are demonstrable as my "perfections". 

He said ..

>
> I am the soul, seated in the heart of every being, I am the beginning, and the middle, and the end also of all beings. I am Vishnu among the Adityas, the resplendent Sun among all luminous bodies; I am Marichi among the Maruts, and the Moon among constellations.[237] 
>
> I am the Sama Veda among the Vedas; I am Vasava among the gods; I am the mind among the senses; I am the intellect in (living) beings. I am Sankara among the Rudras, the Lord of treasures among the Yakshas and the Rakshasas; I am Pavaka among the Vasus, and Meru among the peaked (mountains). [238]

> Know me, O son of Pritha, to be Vrihaspati, the chief of household priests. I am Skanda among commanders of forces. I am Ocean among receptacles of water. I am Bhrigu among the great Rishis, I am the One, undestructible (syllable Om) among words. Of sacrifices I am the Japa-sacrifice.[239] 
>
> Of immobiles I am the Himavat (Himalayas). I am the figtree among all trees, I am Narada among the celestial Rishis. I am Chitraratha among the Gandharvas and the ascetic Kapila among ascetics crowned with Yoga success. Know me to be Uchchaisravas among horses, brought forth by (the churning for) nectar, Airavata among princely elephants, and the king among men. Among weapons I am the thunderbolt, among cows I am (she called) Kamadhuk. I am Kandarpa the cause of reproduction, I am Vasuki among serpents.[240]

> I am Ananta among Nagas, I am Varuna among acquatic beings, I am Aryaman among the Pitris, and Yama among those that judge and punish.[241]

> I am Prahlada among the Daityas, and Time among things that count. I am the lion among the beasts, and Vinata's son among winged creatures. Of purifiers I am the wind. I am Rama among wielders of weapons. I am the Makara among fishes, and I am Jahnavi (Ganga) among streams.[242]
>
> Of created things I am the beginning and the end and also the middle, O Arjuna. I am the knowledge of Supreme Spirit among all kinds of knowledge, and the disputation among disputants.[243]

> Among all letters I am the letter A, and (the compound called) Dwanda among all compounds. I am also Time Eternal, and I am the Ordainer with face turned on every side.[244] 
>
> I am Death that seizeth all, and the source of all, that is to be. Among females, I am Fame, Fortune, Speech, Memory, Intelligence, Constancy, Forgiveness. Of the Sama hymns, I am the Vrihat-sama and Gayatri among mantras. Of the months, I am Margasirsha, of the seasons (I am) that which is productive of flowers.[245]
>
> I am the game of dice of them that cheat, and the splendour of those that are splendid. I am Victory, I am Exertion, I am the goodness of the good. I am Vasudeva among the Vrishnis, I am Dhananjaya among the sons of Pandu. I am even Vyasa among the ascetics, and Usanas among seers. I am the Rod of those that chastise, I am the Policy of those that seek victory. I am silence among those that are secret. I am the Knowledge of those that are possessed of Knowledge. That which is the Seed of all things, I am that, O Arjuna. There is nothing mobile or immobile, which can exist without me. There is no end, O chastiser of foes, of my divine perfections. This recital of the extent of (those) perfections hath been uttered by me by way (only) of instancing them. Whatever of exalted things (there is) or glorious, or strong, understand thou that everything is born of a portion of my energy. 


Thus the "stories" of `Hari` (`Hari Katha`) are the stories of creative accomplishments. From manifestation of a coherent book by a solo writer, to millions of us working together to write Wikipedia —  they signify the upwards trajectory of cognition. Be it the primordial force that instantiated our universe, or the tiny innovations within our realm — from the "wheel" to our  first car(t), or the first flight in open skies,  or the fist light bulb. Or the operating systems, the internet , or the virtual worlds — anything that takes us to higher orbit of consciousness . These stories are endless, because such manifestations are infinite. 

It doesn't really matter if the story is put in factual format with unassuming experimental data, or it is a flight of fancy with dragons or zombies; as long as the narrative targets active upwards progression, it is self consuming and self sustaining. And telling such stories is inspiring as much as listening to them.

Once I understood, what `Hari` stands for, it was easy to comprehend that his stories are endless. Our senses are designed to perceive the manifested — be it an incarnation or a breakthrough idea. We are good at telling stories of the things that we could see, touch or feel :-)  But how do we map our heads to the idea of underlying infinite perpetual force — `Hari Ananta`? Is it even possible to imagine `Hari` in our limited sensory reality? 

To clarify my claim above , understanding  "what `Hari` stands for" , didn't mean I know `Hari`! I only understood that `Hari` is something that progressively takes our consciousness to higher levels. I have no clue what it is and how it does such an immense task. For example just because I know it is the code that runs my desktop ; doesn't mean I know coding! 

Knowing `Hari`, however,  is a chase that we must undertake for the exercise is NOT worthless. In fact, it is the most rewarding quest even though we know that the object of our quest is beyond our sensory perception — definitely beyond our reductive minds. Why? — you may ask. You may say — trying to find something that is beyond our realm is quite futile. And the answer is simple — knowing `Hari` is knowing "who we are"! Because, we are, after all, a superior emergence of consciousness. And the amazing thing is, as we progress in this quest, the "perfections" reveal themselves. The idea is equally applicable whether we take a spiritual or a scientific route to this discovery. They both lead to the same conclusions and the path for each is pretty similar. Gita calls this path "Karm Yoga".

As a first step, `Hari` is obviously not one unique person. One that may incarnate in millions of ways, is obviously not ONE  perceivable God. Narratives may over-glorify the persona, but the intent is always on the fundamental aspect of nature. The underlying force that removes illusions is `Hari`. It is the force that separates 'unreal' from 'real', from "random unformed" to "perfectly organized". Even `Krsna` told `Arjuna` to focus on this underlying force. He said

> Or rather, what hast thou to do, by knowing all this in detail (about my perfections), O Arjuna? Supporting this entire universe with only a portion (of myself), I stand.[246]"

So my quest now boiled down to finding something "infinite" ( `Hari Ananta`)  and something that holds my entire universe with a portion of its strength (`Gita`). What could that be !

In our sensory realm, we may, at best,  describe  `Hari` as some sort of omni-present field. His incarnations are mere representation of a deeper underlying substrate that is beyond our senses — a concious field maybe, one that exists and baffles scientific thinkers as much as followers of scriptures. 

The idea of a universal omnipresent field, that exist in all physical dimensions as well as in every instance of time, is not uncommon. In mid 1800s , Michael Faraday, a brilliant experimental chemist, who ultimately invented the electric motor, was intrigued by magnets. The question he had was simple — one that probably challenges every young mind — why do magnets repel when similar poles are brought near to each other. Unlike most of us, he wondered if it is something to do with the nature of magnets or is there something between the magnets that forces them apart. And unlike most of us, he concluded that between the two magnets, there exists a magnetic field such that it pulls opposite poles towards each other while it repels similar poles. The field surrounds both the magnets with higher intensity though it extends infinitely till the end of the space — feeble it does get at greater distances.

Building on Faraday's conclusion, Maxwell formulated, with mathematical precision, the idea of electro magnetic field. With a hindsight of more than hundred years, we now know that electromagnetic field spans our entire universe. The waves of disturbance in this omnipresent field is what we know as photons - the light. 

Unfortunately, the physics taught in high schools , at least when I attended in the 80s, was at least hundred years behind the curve. Richard Feynman, had already figured out elegant solutions to Dirac's equation of quantum fields though our focus (in high school)  was on the atoms and their constituents - protons, neutrons and electrons as discrete particles that existed without any reason whatsoever. The world seemed to have found the very basic building blocks which was intriguing and exciting for a high schooler. The sad part is , in the guise of this incomplete particle physics, we only slightly brushed the ideas of Maxwell. The electromagnetic field, I thought, had something to do with electricity, which sure ran the TV (we had recently bought)  but it ain't as big a deal as the atom and the atom bomb. How wrong could our curricula be! 

If I were to design the high school physics course for me today in 2023, I would probably leave myself at the definition of a classical field (The electromagnetic field of Maxwell and Einstein). And tell my younger self that it is around 150 years old concept, but this is the one on which they would build the very latest, may be in a university course, but I wouldn't confuse myself with truck load of obsolete thinking. These hundred fifty years are important from the historical perspective in building a quantum definition of our world from contributions of the most brilliant science thinkers such as Planck, Maxwell, Einstein, De Brogli, Bohr, Schrodinger, Dirac , Feynman and many more; but they are important for those who want to indulge in the discovery path ; certainly not me as a high schooler. 

For example,  I wouldn't indulge in the ideas of basic building blocks, such as electrons or protons. Not even quarks or the leptons. Because what we now know for sure, is the fact, that basic building blocks have no meaning without underlying respective fields. The science, particularly physics, meets scripture at this most basic level — the quantum fields. In our physical world, we can continue to go atomic to the realm of electrons and protons but we don't stop there. We have more basic subatomic particles in quarks , leptons and bosons. And these particles are only incarnations of their infinite underlying fields - quantum fields to be precise.

You may argue that I am betting too much on the "Quantum Field Theory" and particularly the "standard model". And you are right because, it is one model that somewhat  mathematically explains our world better than anything else. Better because most of its findings are testable. For the uninitiated ones, or those who read obsolete physics of 80's high schools, Standard model of Quantum Field's Theory, defines twelve particles that make our world. They include three types of quarks (up/down , charm /strange, top and bottom) and three types of Leptons (electron / electron neutrino, Muon / Muon Neutrino, and Tau / Tau Neutrino). These twelve sub atomic particles (along with their anti-particles) rise from their respective quantum fields. In addition to these substance like particles and their underlying fields, there are four more particles to bind the twelve substantive particles together. These are called Bosons. Bosons give rise to the three basic forces - electro-magnetic force (photons), W and Z bosons for week force and eight types of gluons for the strong force. And finally the Higgs boson gives all the substance and force particles their tiny masses. 

So put together, we have sixteen quantum fields. Some of them interact with each other while others are quite inert. These sixteen fields make up our beautiful universe. There are however few problems. The least of which is this model can't fully describe gravity, the fourth force. But it is not for lack of imagination — it is because the mathematics of QFT (quantum field theory) is prohibitive, to say the least. Or we may say that we still need to discover the math. The biggest problem however is - how do we understand the origin or behaviour of the underlying sixteen fields ( though these days number of such basic fields go up to 256 based on who you are talking to) . 

----

The fundamental question for physicist of our ages is —  Why does electro-magnetic field exist? — at every single point in space though we could never directly feel it. Not only one EMF , every point in space has at least fifteen more fields. Are these fields real or they exist in our currently broken mathematics. After all, fields are used only to compute the particle existence - its velocity or the spin. We might push the question of more exotic manifestations such as Protons, Neutrons under the rug as they are simply templates to combine subatomic particles. And so are even more exotic templates that make proteins out of atoms that finally lead to a conscious being such as your dog or me your friend. However, if we examine each of the fields, we come across three basic characteristics:

- First that every field knows how to manifest its particle.
- Second that the knowledge to manifest is held with in the particles of the field or particles of the field with which it interacts.
- The field knows how to NOT manifest imperfect particles - from imperfect I mean particles of smaller size than the basic building blocks.

In essence, all the basic fields have manifestative property, they bear knowledge and they regulate themselves. In `Vaidik` parlance, we define these three properties are `Vishnu`, `Bramh` and `Siva`. If we see all the eternal fields through `Vaidik` lens, then we may not even be required to indulge in sixteen or more fields. There is just one eternal field that is infinite and it creates our beautiful universe with only a part of it's decrypted knowledge and of course regulates it to remove the infinities and irregularities. Just like sub atomic particles, every creation is a specific template that has already been decrypted. The manifestations of these templates are used in evolutionary manner to build more exotic templates.

`Vishnu` is the manifestative potency that uses "intelligence" to decrypt `Brmha` - the underlying knowledge base. It is the accumulation of certain quantum of knowledge ( with rigor) that suddenly  precipitates into success perceivable by our senses. The beauty of the framework is that the `Bramh` rises out of `Vishnu` for the knowledge is held in infinite relationships between manifested things. From human to human, from a tree to another, and between non-living to living and between subatomic particles. The infinite network of connections between everything to every other thing is `Bramha`, for knowledge is held in the synapses (parameters) of this vast ginormous  network. `Vishnu` is the cause of `Bramha` and `Bramha` incarnates `Vishnu`, for ever higher conscious progression, finally leading to a state of absolute knowledge - `Siva`. This super refined knowledge `Siva` is what maintains the continuum. It curates the omnipresent expanse of the underlying field, curtails it and cares for it.

----

In essence, this genre of story telling, where intelligent endeavour meets the divine grace of knowledge, to create the next big thing or a tiny improvement - next big shift or a better way to do what we been doing for centuries,  is auspicious. In `Vaidik` traditions, `Vishnu` is invoked to start any significant undertaking. The mantra from `Garuda Purana` is generally used to invoke `Vishnu` ..

It is in this spirit, with hands folded, and being aware of the infinite expanse of her creations, I present my humble submission `Mathura` - a historical narrative that investigates the time, and situations when humanity first discovered the "written word" as a medium to preserve knowledge. But more importantly, it understood what the knowledge is ...

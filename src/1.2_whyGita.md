## Why Gita

A skeptical mind is a good thing. After all, we owe our survival to our ability to question everything that comes our way. We must take on a direction only if it appeals to our rationale - beyond dogma and hearsay. In addition, we need to be able to see beyond survival because the survival is almost ensured by  `Bramha` - the overarching system ,  as long as we are willing to pay a little cost. A little cost in terms of our basic duties. Goes without saying, that we get garbage collected and recycled if we don't meet up our obligations. Obligations to our planet , the  mankind , the nations, work, family and even our own body. Or we can say that survival is about following the rules of the game. Again, it is a tolerant platform. We can choose what we want to do. We can reduce our bills. We can even get by doing very little as long as we are not harmful to other constituents of the system. But survival is just meeting the bare minimum. Game has so much more to offer. And above all - we have free will. The choices that we make have far reaching consequences - beyond survival and mere "getting by". 

If we choose to to  approach a faculty that is somewhat in the realm of religion or spirituality , things are seldom "black and white". That is one reason why science and math is so popular these days. It offers an unambiguis method - at least at the face of it..  ; typical way to address any initial  inquiries, is to black box the questions. I have been through this rigmarole many times. First do the following and then you will know the answer. And they would say , you had automatically know the answers, just have blind faith :-)  .  For that matter, even in science or technology, when we try to pursue a new stream , we need to wait, put some effort , at least understand the basic vocabulary before we could even frame the right questions .. That said , it is easy to black-box our questions into an unknown variable and have us perform certain set of activities before the variable is exposed. Only to find later that black-box was actually an empty box. There was no cat in it . Is the concept of `Atma` , the [protected] knowledge one such black-box? 

I also challenged the concept with the same argument. Here is my rationale before I took on the journey. I mean that is what we do for we can't see or forecast the future. We apply rationale to choose the most optimum way to spend our time, and move forward. The first obvious comfort was .. 

### It didn't ask me to give up anything. 

I love my life. Frankly, there are not many complaints. The ideas of Gita appealed to me because it is not asking me give up my life for a strange unknown blessing. All it basically says is just do your duties. The things that you would anyway be doing. And if not you will be forced to do anyways. 

### No religious overload .
It didn't ask me to visit a temple or light up the candles at a church. In fact it didn't sound religious at all. It calls for realization of your inner "self" and it says once you know yourself, you are the God. And that is what the scientific inquiry is. We climb the heights of Himalayas and sink to the depths of oceans; we venture deep dark space , for what ? Ultimately we want to find out who we are ? Or is there someone else like us ?

Despite being part of Hindu scripture (s), Gita doesn't belong to any religion nor does it advocate a specific God or a specific way to worship. In fact, it  rejects the popular religious ideas. The situation itself was very symbolic - You have a king talking  to a prince in the middle of a war. There were no long bearded monks there. This discourse was NOT at a Himalayan cave . In fact , it was not even a discourse - it was a one on one conversation. And the out come of this conversation  was the biggest blood shed ever known to the mankind - at least, till the time of its writing. There sure is nothing religious about it. 
### A very different approach 

It came as a fresh air to my goal (outcome) oriented thirty years through the corporate ladder. Everything should not be a calculation. I should be able to do things just for my (inner) sake. 

### Made me more effective 

Being attached to "Actions" made me more effective at my chores. I got better at fitness. Once I stopped chasing a number for "Financial Independence" and started focusing on right investment actions, the number automatically came through. 

**All above are good, but the thing that really won me over ...**

## The sharp logic 

If we start a game, a common perception is that there are two possible outcomes  - we win , or we lose. Win means we are happy, lose means life sucks. In a normal game, if we keep on losing, ultimately we will run out of the chips or the casino will close (assuming we are not at 24 X 7 Las Vegas :-) . 

**So the third possible outcome is the game ends**


>> What if we are in a game that can't be stopped ....ever. 

Isn't life one such game ? Leaving the concept of reincarnation at a bay (for the time being ) - I asked myself - Is it possible to be alive but not play the game ! 

### Can I pack my cards ? 

The obvious answer was to get to a sustainable financial independence[FI], resign the regular job. Try to live with in my means. I did all that .. But many of you who reached FI would vouch - the game doesn't stop. Portfolio,  pandemics and politics never stop. And of course the body itself needs us to go on .. It goes on and on . Only the  events change - cycles don't. Desires , happiness and Pain are kinda built into us. No matter where we go , no matter what we do,  our mind can't get over the game . 

There seems no option to pack the cards ,  sit in the casino bar and just enjoy a drink - no game. 

Even if I don't "use" the exit, there must be one. Where is my third option ? To just "be" .. at peace. I thought doing "nothing" .. I thought doing "nothing" might work. It doesn't. In fact , being able to do nothing is very difficult. It is the freedom. Freedom is actually tied to the actions. Anyone can think or imagine whatever they want to ; but that is not so when it comes down to actions. For actions we need permissions. There are permissions to be sought at the work place, at home ; even from our own body. Our ability to do what we want to is freedom. And if you want to do "nothing", then being able to do that is freedom. Turns out this ultimate freedom ain't possible. No matter what we do , we still need to breathe, drink , eat and millions of other chores to run this body. With every single layer of sophistication or automation, we add another layer of chores that must be done. Charging your cell phone is now as important as drinking water :-)

It just seems unfair that I was neither asked if I wanted to play in the first place, nor do I have permission to leave. No doubt this is a beautiful physical reality but it seems like a beautiful jail if we don't have the permission to see past it. Or do whatever we want to . On top of that - the reincarnation thing (if true) sounds as if , I am stuck here for the eternity , playing these Squid games :-) . Isn't it ?

## Gita's take on this HARD problem .. 

Gita says where the world looks at only two outcomes - heaven or hell ; both being here in this physical reality ,   there does exist a third option - `Nirvana` - that is to exit this game . Heaven is symbolic of the pleasures of favourable outcome - hell is quite the opposite - the sustained stay of pain. But there is no "Peace" if that is what exit looks like. 

In a way, the physicality around us doesn't limit our imagination but it puts a control on our actions. It lets our imagination fly but it mandates certain actions if we want the same thing in real life. In other words, thicker the physical layer, more effort does it take to get to what we want to do. The actions that our inner self drives. For example let us say a its a beautiful sunny day outside. You want to walk with your dogs but then you have deliverables tied to your job. That job ensures payment of the bills. The roof on your heads and the food on the table. 

While most religiously oriented philosophies and even the common sense would suggest to renounce this physical reality ; cut down our needs because that seems like an easier path to get to what we want to do, Gita says, such a path doesn't work because the impulse to indulge is lot stronger than what we can renounce. It suggests to indulge in everything that this reality needs because we must pay the cost attached, but it adds to do so without any attachment. In fact, it says we must do all that the physical reality demands of us for not meeting our obligations is a theft . On the other hand , if we do all that is required of us and then return all the rewards back with humility, that is the path to exit. It is a win win approach  .. Krishna says 

> Ishtaan [ Desired] Bhogan [ necessities and indulgences] Hi [ certainly]  Vo [ unto you] Devah [ demi gods] Dasyante [ will reward] Yajna-Bhavitah [ Satisfied with your ritualistic approach to the tasks];
>
> Taih [ by them] Dattan [ things so given] Apradaya [ without offering] Ebhayah [ to these demigods] , Yo [ one who] Bhukte [ enjoys the things] Stenah [ thief] Eva [ certainly] Sah [] .
>
> if you indulge in actions as a ritual, the universe will return the favor. It will give you all that you want. But if you consume all that without first offering it back, you are a thief. 

In essence giving up the fruits of your worldly actions is the path to exit - The `Nirvana` Krishna says - `Nirvana` is the real victory and that is the real goal. And he proposes `Karm Yoga` as the only path. In essence, Gita gives a new destination and also paves the singular path to it . Why singular ? why only path ? Because , it says , all other paths finally lead to `Karm Yoga`. 

In nutshell, it says that the pains and happiness are attached to the "the expectations v/s the outcomes".  If  favorable we are happy , Otherwise not.  Actions done without  attachment , on the other hand, have two different properties - peace and knowledge. If we focus on actions (and do them as a ritual without attachment- `Yajna`) we will attain the peace and decrypt the  knowledge. And finally this knowledge automatically solves the puzzle and thus exit - `Nirvana`. 

>> And here is the Kicker - It says that we don't need to perform any special drill ... All we need to do is just change your approach to "Actions" . From attached to detached. 

### No Brainer

That sounded like a no Brainer.. Isn't it ? If all I need to do is change the approach to things I anyway do - invest in stocks,  love my dogs, run , chat with friends, take care of a family , drink some good wine and come up with occasional tweets :-)  ; then obviously there is no down side to trying out `Nirvana` route ..

### Alexa - put me on `Nirvana` mode

Unfortunately , Alexa still doesn't have the `Nirvana` skill :-) . So the journey is really to learn (and experiment) how to focus solely on "Actions" . Without any consideration to "outcomes". 

Turns out it is harder than what I thought. Desires creep into every thing we do. Thus `Karm Yoga` is a skill , just like playing the Violin. The good news is Gita has all the information. We still need to practice though ; because just information is not sufficient. Gita is experiential. 

Even better news is, the work done on this path never goes wasted. This assurance comes from the "auto save mode" :-) Krishna knows, we will wander off track ; get swayed by the desires- thus the assurance that once we start on `karmYoga` , just like swimming , we will never forget it. We can always come back at any point, reset our password (if forgot), and get started from where we left .. 

### Isn't Nirvana a Desire ?

Yes it is, aspiring to exit is also a desire, a desired outcome..what a catch :-) .. I thought to myself !

Gita says - only till we are learning . Once we attain `Karm Yoga`, even the desire to exit vanishes - thus the eternal peace. In fact `Karm Yoga` is not about exiting the life. It is about ridingthe wave above the cycles of happiness and pains. Exit happens whenever it needs to happen .. At this stage we are not even a `Karm Yogi` ..we are simply a `Yogi`  - means connected. 

In chapter 3, the first verse of Krishna responding to questions of Arjuna. He says .. 

> Loke [in the world] Asmin [this] Dwi-Vidha [two kinds of] Nishtha [faith] Pura [previously] Prokta [said] Maya [by me] Anagha [O sinless Arjun];
>
> Jnana Yogena [with ritual of knowledge] Sankhyanam [by philospphers] Karm Yogen [with ritiual of actions] Yoginam [by Yogies].

So Krishna, having understood the confusion that still prevailed in the mind of biggest warrior and his friend and he talks back to him with love and respect, he says - O sinless Arjuna , There are two types of faith in this world as told by me previously Nyana yoga for the philosophers and scientists and Karma Yoga for the Yogies - those who are connected to me. 

And eventually the `Nyaan Yogies` too find that `Karm Yoga` is the path to realize the knowledge that they were anyway striving for. 

# If all these reasons don't suit you or meet your situation, here is the last. Gita , and Mahabharata (in general), are the work of poetic expression par excellence and probably a more consuming  mega-tale than the one you ever heard. Exploring Gita, purely as a basis to quench your intellectual thrust and reading requirements is a good enough incentive to entertain the idea.  

Having been on this path for now five-ish years , I had say that there is no down side to `Karm Yoga` because it makes you more productive and efficient in whatever field you are in , kinda the best version of us; however, I wouldn't misguide that it is an easy choice. Separating actions from desires is HARD. Desires keep creeping into whatever we do. And that is the topic of first chapter of this book - `Karm Yoga` - the ritual of Actions.

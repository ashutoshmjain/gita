> As we know, we are trained in this survival oriented world - which is not a bad thing. But that means we are continuously focused on our senses. Ears included. And senses only consume. There is only one way to communicate our external and internal experience. That is through speech. Our eyes and our facial expressions do help but speech is the primary way to communicate. We can of course write these days but we write what we want to speak. In other words writing is a way to store the speech data. So we have five senses consuming all sorts of information and our body acting accordingly and there is one throat to say and explain our experience.

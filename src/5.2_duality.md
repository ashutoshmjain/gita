Let us say , you woke up in the middle of the night - in a room with all the windows closed . And no watches or cell phones. You might wonder how is it outside ? Day or night ? The room has hidden the truth from you. As long as something is hidden , there needs to be a place for speculation or guesstimate. This place is called "doubt" - `Sanshya`. Our ability to speculate different possibilities is what we know as "Reason". 

Let us build this logic little more ..

If you ever travelled in a train, particularly a Swiss train- the thing is so stable that you can leave a glass of water without ever spilling it even if you are climbing the Alps. If you see outside the train, you see the trees running in opposite direction while you feel stationary your self. Thanks to the train being so quiet and shake free, you see from the window that trees outside are moving but you can reason that trees are stationary while the train is moving. Just like when you woke up (in the middle of the night) , you saw everything is dark but you could reason it was broad day light outside. Let us now use the same faculty of mind - the "reason"  to see why every manifestation we perceive is dualistic - there is at least one more possible scenario v/s the truth it carries. One truth and rest everything a lie - many of them so not true that we can discard with "reason". 

> "Reason" is a faculty of "Intelligence" - `Chitta` to discard many many obvious lies. Not to hide the `Truth".

So here is the reason.. 

Manifestation is the final iteration of the `Yajna`. You may recall from previous chapters that manifestation itself is information. Information, by design, is something that can be "informed" to the senses. Which means, the broader aspect of knowledge is always hidden (encrypted) in the manifestations. Which means there is always room for speculation. 

> Doubt is inbuilt into every observation of manifestations. 

Just like removing fickleness is essential to stabilize the mind, appreciation and careful analysis of the "doubts" is a requirement for stabilising the intelligence. In fact , `Yajna` is nothing but a trial and error of various doubts. Let us go back to the baseball - you think you can hit the ball for a home run if you shifted your weight to the front foot while taking the wild swing .. You must dispel all the doubts on this strategy. That is only when you will do it wholeheartedly. Afterwards you may find that it didn't work. And then you choose the next strategy. And so on with the next and the next practice scenario till you actually hit the homerun. And even then you need to repeat it many times over to make sure all the remaining doubts are set aside. 

In essence , intelligence is reductive. It creates very many probable scenarios and breaks them into ever smaller routines. And then it makes us iterate through each in pursuit of decrypting the knowledge. The problem is if we attach expectations , they , clubbed with fickle mind further extend the doubts. In essence "doubt" and "fickleness" feed on each other. They never let you take the next step in your ritual. You move from one plan to another - endlessly. Thus resorting to `Nishkaam Karma` leaving all the outcomes to the `Krishna` is the best strategy to dispel the `Duality".

## Duality as depicted in `Hath Yoga`

`Hath Yoga` may seem empirical but it is a useful tool to explain the nature of our reality to one who believes in it. I am not a practitioner but I just marvel at the extensive thinking that must have gone into it. Someone really thought throug the entire scheme before coming out with this model. 

If you see fig 3 in last chapter, `Kundalini` represents intelligence and it lies folded (like a snake) in the `Mooldhara Chakra`. That is where all the `Samskara` - The basic values , stay dormant. Thus intelligence can easily decrypt the basics to give you what we call your `Svabhava` - your nature. In normal person, it rises to next `Chakra` by adolecence . The puberty and setting up the sexual desires. Taking the `Kundalini` above the second `Chakra` is difficult.  For most people `Kundalini` stays in botttom two `Chakras`. 

As a representation of duality , `Bindu` - The focus ( doubtless state) resides in the top `Chakra` named `Sahsrara`. `Bindu` is the kind of a focal point of observation. In a way, it is to say that we indulge in such `Vrittis` where we take the focal spotlight. Thus there are two ways to realize effectiveness - either keep the Bindu in top `Chakra` or raise the `Kundalini` to the top ; for a healthy blissful life. 

As per `Hathyoga Pradeepika` -  the 101 of `Tantra` , of these two paths,  in the early part of the life, intelligence is too occupied in decrypting the basic values that trying to take it to the top `Chakra` is futile. In addition, during this time , the focus falls to `Manipura` - the third Chakra from bottom and burns in digestion which means we are too much focused on food. The leftover focus goes down to `Swadhisthana` the second `Chakra` which means intense focus of eating and procreation. Thus the book suggests to hold the focus in higher `Chakras` in early parts of the life. It suggests various `Mudras` and `Mantras` for accomplishing this. 

If you fail to hold the focus in head in  the first part of life  then the second option for you (in later part of the life) is to raise the `Kundalini` to the top. Having developed your intellect, later part of the life is best suited for this endeavour. Again , `Pradeepika` provides many `Mudras` and `Mantras` for this. The ultimate goal is to bring get knowledge and intelligence together situated in the head to end the "Duality".


## Matrix

Duality in itself is not bad. In fact it fuels the reason and makes us try different options to perfect our rituals. The question is how does it (along with fickle mind) turn into Matrix - `Maya`.

>Matrix is as old as the knowledge - means there is no end or no beginning of Maya. Matrix is so prevelent that  concious agents start confusing it with `Prakriti` - the intelligence. 

In Hindi , `Maya` literally means money but it represents a large system of millions of concious constituents. Using example of a large is the most accessible way for me to highlight some of the constructs of Matrix. 

### User Interface 

Imagine you are tasked  to build a UI for an application. The very purpose of User Interface to manage the needs of the users. A user logging into Twitter may think that the application is "only" the User Interface but nothing can be far from the truth (side note - Twitter is a data science  app where human slaves happily spend their only currency - time , to train the machines get better at data mining) . New developers too  sometimes  make this mistake. They start designing the application from the user interface. The truth is application is lot more than the UI. User Interface is the last piece to help users consume the application. Building an application with UI in mind is not a bad idea but if all you are thinking is the UI , you can not build any thing new . You will simply replicate that you have already seen because application is necessarily to solve a problem that you feel in your experience. You do a Yajna to manifest a solution for yourself. And the left over (manifested information) can be used by others. A slight improvement in UI can possibly help others. That is where User Interface comes. 

# ID

Let us say you have a global app like Instagram that was built to easily share pictures. Now you want to enable entire world to leverage the tools you built. Each user needs to manage their own pics. You need to relate the pics of each user to them. That means you must identify the user. The user interface demands an ID. 

>>>>There is no way to serve you your choices unless I know who you are !

If you use git , you know what is the application. It solves the problem of managing the versions (tracking the gradual decryption of knowledge). Github is a user interface over git. 

> ID is not a bad thing but it has aftereffects. 

# Matrix

Let us say you wrote a script to do something. It took elaborate curiosity, intelligence and actions to build it. On the way you decrypted a piece of knowledge and you are at peace. Thing is so perfect that now you don't even need to think. Yajna is complete. Manifestation is registered. It is end to end automated. 

## Machine 

What if you want it to automatically start at a certain time. You wrote another script to schedule it, another small `yajna` to understand the scheduler. Now you add both the manifestations. They are self starting manifestations joined back to back. You just made a "Machine"

You can weave thousands of tiny machines to make as big a machine as you want. A machine takes in commands and delivers an information. In a way it is the transformation of information without having to apply thinking or actions. So you can use machines to get to a specific set of information. It helps to get to your `Yajna` quickly. 

The knowledge inside the machine is totally encrypted to you. Even how the information reshapes from inputs to outputs ; is opaque. More complex the machine , more magical it is. 

You thought your friends will be benefited by your little complex machine, you passed on the code and commands. 

The thing is beautiful. 

Note - machines - complex machines --> consumption of consumption ---> Suddenly the knowledge becomes the most hidden thing -- > Awaken -- Action.
## Service 

Then you came up with an idea to let it go to the masses. You share your resources to help other people. You get to perform your `yajna` many times over and you help people. 

## ID

Then you started keeping a record of what all people need and how and when you can help them. You created your conscious agents. 

## User Interface 

If you know it , why not let people see it. You build a simple user interface . All the information about everyone is visible to all. You also created the senses (touch or mouse or audio) and trained people with the new senses. Yes , we acquire many senses beyond basic five .. 

## Privacy

Then you were asked to keep everyone's information separate from each other and let them see only their information. 

>You just built Matrix. 

# What is wrong with the matrix ?

Nothing. There is nothing wrong with Twitter or Facebook. Or the monetary system. You just triggered a race among your conscious agents. Your service has a some surival or pleasure value to the users. That is the reason they are there in the first place. As soon as something is hidden , it means we are allowing users to speculate. Speculation builds reasons to justify your position v/s [unknown] Truth. This is the birth of "Duality and Reason". These two fuel the Matrix. 

>>It doesn't matter if the speculation is same as the Truth. As long as Truth is unknown there must be a placeholder for speculation. 

That is the reason user interface it self is Dualistic. There is male and female, East - West , Left -Right . Opposites exists for everything. 

## Matrix Hides

## Mechanics of Matrix 

Matrix acts in a subtle fashion . Means its rise is gradual. 

As we have seen, Matrix puts a veil on Truth to create speculation among conscious agents. Speculation leads to Reason (what if scenarios) , Reason leads to Doubt - `Sanshya` ; and "Doubt" clubbed with "Desires" (fundamental of all bugs) , creates "fickle mind" - `Mana`. The primary purpose of `Mana` is to render your "Intelligence" - `Budhi` dormant so that you are consumed in sensory pleasures. 

Now you know the design of Facebook :-) 

As your intelligence goes dormant, the knowledge in stays fully encrypted but you can easily be automated. You  become part of the matrix. 

>>>>>> Gita says this is the sleeping stage of conscious agent. 


# Concious Agent 

A concious agent is born in the matrix because the ID services of thousands if matrix applications finally shape up concious agent. In a way a concious agent is manifested because of relentless `Yajna` of Maya. Thus concious agent too has a fully encryted copy of knowledge as well as it inherits the five bugs. 

These bugs lead the conscious agent to take consume the matrix. Desire is a precursor for curiosity. Anger is a precursor to `Yajna`. 

From Gita's stand point - such a conscious agent is in "slept" state inside the matrix. Nishkaam Yajna is the way to know your self and become awakened conscious agent. 

You don't leave the matrix. You are just aware of all the knowldge spread into every single machine of matrix. Thus you can bend the matrix the way you want. 

Awakened conscious agents are like the light bulbs lighting up in the mesh of Maya. 

## A universe in itself .. 

In a way a concious agent is complete embodiment of the universe  because it has all elements of Yajna (knowledge to decrypt and ability to act)  and all the bugs of the Matrix. It has tools to seek knowledge and at the same time tools (the bugs) to indulge in Matrix. It all depends where the concious agent is looking at - If she is looking at the matrix - as per Gita, she is sleeping. If it is looking at knowledge then it is awakened. 

Krishna says - This human body itself is the true field - `Kshetra`. Knowing your Truth is knowing the entire meta-physical world. 

# Consciousness 

Now imagine the this huge app - mother of all apps - the reality- The Matrix. Let us try to build a user interface for it .. 

>>>> Consciousness is simply the ability (of a concious agent) to interact with the Matrix. 

We know our users have curiosity `Mana` , they also have intelligence `Buddhi` and we just gave them an ID - Ability to "Reason" a Speculation v/s Truth . But what is the use of interface if they don't have means to interact with it. Apple had to create a mouse so that you can interact with the graphical interface. And later the touch interface . It seems now we are all now moving to the audio interface with Alexa. And long before all this was the text based interface that we call command line. 

How about we give some gestures to our users  .. 

>>>>> Senses are the tools that enable us to interact with the UI --> Matrix ---> Giant Machine with fully encrypted knowledge. 

Humans have five primary senses. Most other mammals too. But it is not necessary to have only five. Fish have only three senses. Trees have only one - touch. 

# Getting back to the humans 

Five senses, along with Curiosity , intelligence and Ego (Reason) is what makes a Conscious Agent 

Gita calls it `Ashtdhamool Prakriti` - means the eight basic parts of the universal manifestation. 

Let us spend some time on the senses.




# Notes 

# Duality
- Based on the direct observations (or communicated ones), conscious agent needs to decide if there is a change in the intensity of field. If there is no change, there is no action needed.
- By design, observation creates DUALITY. Every observation has the question in-built into it - `is there a change ?` - Yes or No. If `Yes` , do I need to act ? `Yes or No`. Duality gives rise to INTELLIGENCE `Buddhi`.
- It is debatable if the `duality` is the reason of observations or the variations in sense fields create duality. The goal `Moksha` is to get over the duality. If there is no duality, we are just `one`. There is whole lot of scriptures dedicated to this topic - `adwitwad vs Dwaitvaad`
- If action is to be taken then what action? And a whole list of sub-activities.
- There are as many shades in a color as many colors on the pallet. Means if you are a part of categorized list , then all those categories live in you as well. Their percentages may vary but you essentially represent every other category as any other category does. Thus seeing the truth is difficult. 
- Duality lives in the information. Knowledge is just one. Karm Yoga is a way to be one with knowledge so that you can see only True version of information. Means single Truth. 
- You may say it is a circular self fulfilling prophecy - 
- Duality is not all bad - one of the thing that duality offers is you can latch on to a `Guru`. In traditional `Hath Yoga` the `Chakra` between your eyes - with two petals is what represents duality. A `Guru` touches this place and removes duality . That is the reason , this Chakra is also called `Agya` - the order. In a way it is to say you are outsourcing the thinking part (manan and chintan) to your `Guru` and all you are going to do is follow the orders `Agya` to engage in the actions. In traditional Hindu rituals , when men used to go to war, the women used to put a `Tilak` to men between the eyes. The idea was that leave your duality with us , go win the war with a single purpose of winning.

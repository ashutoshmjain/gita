If you are following Gita , particularly from chapter seven onwards , you must have noticed a logical flow building out 

- In chapter seven Krishna defined his lower nature - the material world ; and the upper nature - the consciousness. Think of these as two separate aspect of the modern science. Quantum Mechanics, particularly, Quantum Field theory is our best attempt at understanding the material world around us. Whereas computing , particularly artificial intelligence is our best shout out to understanding consciousness. 
- Chapter 8 builds on these two aspects. Defining the framework of this game. How consciousness is trapped with in material aspect. The entire architecture of the game. Yet he says he is beyond the game. The entire manifestation of the material world as well as the consciousness beings are suspended with in the divine. The creation he explains happens through Visarga . The act of letting go. A state beyond cause and effect because there is no desire for the actions. Desire is what creates karmik bondage to the game. The very perception of the reaction of actions is due to attached desires. 
- Chapter 9 provides core instructions to the conscious beings with in the game - a path to attain his own state with in the game. A state where humans may reach the state of his own divine essence. 
- And here in chapter ten, Krishna describes the his own reflections with in this game. A method to recognize his essence. But more importantly, he states that the entire universe is held with a tiny fraction of his craft as a divine creator. This is where we come back to Quantum Mechanics again. The science is beyond doubt that the observable universe is just a tiny fraction of all that is out there. The mass in the observable space is just too less to account for the gravity. Where is this gravity coming from ? And why is gravity so hard to assimilate with other three fundamental forces?  For lack of better word, scientists call it Dark Energy or Dark matter. Something beyond our scientific apparatus. Gita says even Gods are part of his lower and upper manifestation. The underlying code may be. But knowing Krishna is beyond Gods too. He is the science and spirit together. An underlying field that creates the perception and the perceived through his sheer detachment. 

Lets listen to the ode.

`Abhivaykti` (noun) means expression. While inner (evolutionary) knowledge is inexpressible (`Avykta`), because it can't be vocalized or written down, knowledge acquired through external store of information could be expressed (`Vykta`) with varying degree of success. A distinction must be made here - most of the communications we receive in the physical world are only "information". For example when we buy a product with a user manual, all we are getting is "how to use the gadget" - that is information. In order to convey "knowledge" both sender as well as the receiver must be willing to put in enormous repetitive efforts. Thus communication of externally acquired "knowledge" is possible but with "varying degree of success"!

Humans and animals, alike, do convey random glimpses of inner knowledge through reflex muscular postures (`Mudra`)  — primarily facial in humans. Animals express through various bodily postures, for example a dog stretches as a signal that she is ready to run. A tiger pauses before the chase. Even trees and plants express by shedding their leaves or folding the flowers - though such expressions lack standardisation and thus are hard to interpret.

Humans developed exceptional sophistication in vocal expression. Every vocal art form, seeks to enhance this sophistication to the next level. In West, vocal expression probably reaches its zenith in "opera". On the Eastern side, it achieves perfection through `Vaidik` recital — a format so distinguished that the most exquisite language `Sanskrit`, finds it's roots in `Vaidik` recital. The rigor of these expression is what makes them an "art-form". The audience is pulled into the recital for repeated listening,  thanks to the repetitive efforts baked in the expression. We do feel as if "knowledge" is on display! We feel connected with the reciter. Such expressions that connect us with the source are called state of "`Yoga`" which literally means connected.

Vocals, however, have  a limitation — they are not the best storage medium. Reciters always tend to add their own distortion(s) to the recital no matter how hard they practice. And they may forget if they didn't practice for few days. The biggest problem in the olden days, however, was that audio was neither portable nor asynchronous - It needed physical presence in same space and time.  Written word had to be invented to circumvent this limitation. 

Humans' expression (`Abhivakti`) , once attained perfection through rigorous practice, thus has three primary categories ..
- muscular (`Mudra Yoga`) - dance forms (or acting) to express evolutionary impulses; 
- recital (`Naad Yoga`) - to disseminate knowledge; 
- and written word (`Nyaan Yoga`) - primarily as a store of knowledge. 

It  is quite obvious from the definitions above, that `Mudra` Yoga needs a touch point with our internal knowledge to give it an expression.  `Mudra` was further refined into `Hath Yoga` - the complex postures to stretch and unlock internal energies - the common perception of `Yoga` in the west.  

Effectively only two contenders emerged as potential carrier of knowledge - recital (from one generation to the next) and the transcription.  It took a while to appreciate that they were complimentary to each other for both of them at a deeper level needed intimate connection with our own "self" ..   and the journey was full of conflicts ..


# `Abhivakti`

The craft of reciting `mantras` with an ascetic lifestyle purposed for a singular focus on diction, was called `Naad Yoga`. This `yoga`, like many others, must be practiced with a strict daily routine (`Bramhacharya`). The idea was to tune human body into the skill of understanding, memorizing and chanting, by removing all the material distractions. On the other hand, the devotion to exploration and research (in chosen faculties) was called `Nyaan Yoga`. 

The meaning of `Yoga` is to connect with, and to tap into our internal knowledge. A `Nyaan Yogi` would harness the inner knowledge in the pursuit of external. A `Naad Yogi` would do the same for the purpose of rendition. Both were complimentary to each other. There was no point in cumulating knowledge if it was of no use to the masses, or couldn't be preserved over generations. Similarly, there was nothing to recite if it didn't carry specific knowledge. Thus, `Naad Yogies` worked in close interaction with `Nyaan Yogies`.  The role of `Vyasa` was of utmost importance in holding these two streams of `Yoga` together. It was like a bridge between knowledge and expression. Hence, a very sought after title and one that needed dexterity in both. `Vyasas` controlled the flow of information — somewhat like the editors of main stream media these days. They decided what must go to the public consumption, what could be left to obscurity. 

This arrangement for cultivation and consumption of knowledge through rigorous focus and gratitude is now a days called `Snatana Dharma` - the first and oldest religion and the one that never decays; though it is a misnomer because it was long before organized religion came into being. `Sanatana` was the way of life for at least ten generations of `Vaśiṣṭhas` - starting well before `Rama` and going up to the days of `Krishna`. During this period, it gathered enormous social and political respect and thus substantive clout on the direction of mankind. 

With great power comes the conflict. Some `Rishies` wanted to make their work imperishable by committing it to a text format themselves. But such attempts were doomed, for the written language was not standardized. And writing tools were still in their infancy.

An ascetic lifestyle was important for `Naad Yogies`. Not only was it necessary for extreme focus on recital, a rich host would select a trusted ‘rites administrator’ because s/he knew the ritual maker didn't want any of the material gains — an assurance that all the blessings would come directly to the host (without any cut). In a way, rites were the market place between humans and their deities where a `Naad Yogi` acted like a catalytic intermediary. Humans invested their allegiance, time and money while deities provisioned things they wanted in the return. No one knew for sure if the market place actually worked, but it was a matter of belief, and it worked for those who believed. More than the apparent divine exchange, the arrangement funded the entire ‘knowledge ecosystem’. 

The rich hosts and the powerful, as patrons, provided enough alms and homage to allow `Yogies` invest their time in spiritual as well as in material research. This primary research led to ground breaking discoveries and insights that influenced at least four major religions — Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism; along with hundreds of factions that thrive in South Asia and beyond. Not only religion, it also formed the primitive basis of science that includes linguistics, mathematics, cosmology, medicine, surgery, and lot more. It was like the "open source" movement of our time. `Yogies` shared their knowledge free of charge and lived on donations hence collected.

The formalization of rituals ensured the knowledge stayed immutable over the course of passage from one generation to the next. Imagine a world without written word — no books, no libraries and of course no internet. In that world, `Naad Yogies` were the vessels of knowledge that held water from different relevant streams of `Nyaan Yoga`. They individually represented at least one of the hundred (`shut` - where "sh" is pronounced as in "shine",  "u" is pronounced as in "but" and "t" is pronounced with tongue touching upper teeth) skills.  For example a skill such as a doctor (`Vaidya`) may need knowledge of herbs (`Vrakayurveda`), anatomy and body functions (`Ayurveda`) and deep understanding of seasons for all all herbs don't grow in all the seasons (`Krushi`). Collectively `Naad Yogies` were called `shut-osha`. The syllable "osha" represents a vast collection - commonly used to represent a big treasury - called `Kosha` in `Sanskrit` or `Tosha` - means a vast collection of satisfaction.

The literal meaning of word `Naad` is a dense voluminous sound produced from the bottom of lungs. `Aacharyas and Shastries` were essentially `Naad Yogies`. Through years of practice and sacrifice, they had learnt to focus internal knowledge in upper `Chakras`[^chakra] -  in heart `Chakra` (`Anahata`) for compassion, and in throat `Chakra` (`Vishudhi`) for vocal expression. 

It was deemed a proof of being distinct from rest of the species. Other species held the life energies in two lower `Chakras` namely — `Swadhishthana` — the `Chakra` of sexuality and `Manipuraka` — the `Chakra` of consumption.  By moving the energy upwards, sometimes also referred to as raising the `Kundalini`, `Naad Yogies` separated humanity from animal kingdom, while still being a seeker of peace (and prosperity) for all the species. They believed it was `Naad Yoga` that made humans bipedal in the world of quadrupedal mammals. Not only that taller you stand, longer you could speak ; the vertical spinal column allowed the `Kundalin` to rise, thereby opening access to upper `Chakras`.

By bringing life force to throat, `Naad Yogies` perfected the repeatable public recital, making it an ‘art of vocal expressions’. If your interest is peaked in what kind of renditions were these, I recommend listening to this one-minute clip of `Shanti Mantra` from `Brahmin` priest Santosh Mudgal [here](https://www.siddhayoga.org/shanti-mantras/om-dyauh-shanti). Notice the stresses on the syllables and over-all elocution. `Vaidik` elocution is a complete genre of rendition practiced standing tall or sitting in upright position. Speech is restricted lying down or any other posture (`Asana` or `Yougic Mudra`) that curls the spinal column.

There was no “generally” cherished art of 'writing'. The primary use of written word was to send telegrams through pigeons. Short, cryptic and perishable. There were attempts to write messages on the cave walls or on the interiors of temples. Small chisels and hammers were adapted (from sculpting) for this purpose  but the process remained utterly time consuming as well as painstaking.

Some researchers of knowledge — `Nyaan Yogies`, did consider the idea of converting the `Mantras` into text format — even before `Parāśara`, for obvious advantages of durability and portability.  What if all the `Vyasas` died? What if human race met its demise though epidemic, or other extinction level event. The ancient wisdom must be preserved beyond human shelf life. Those questions existed, but without the comfort of a Mac, “writing” was a herculean task! There were some bold attempts. But they were mostly experimental in nature — half-baked, grammatically obsolete and contextually incoherent. The focus was not on the content. It was on the 'writing apparatus' and to test the claims of “writing” aficionados. The advocacy on the pro-text side was the obvious notion of asynchronous freedom. Some of them believed in the crazy stuff - they claimed that if text could be passed from one generation to the next, the reverse should also be possible - written word , being time insensitive, might flow from future to the past. They called such a flow as "Divine information" . And the promise that the divine information could be made accessible to all. Something like the original promise of the internet! 

It also allowed the `Nyaan Yogies` engaged in life long pursuits to remember intermediate discoveries because they didn't have a tool based framework to memorize the history of their research - something like taking notes and reminders! In absence of a version management system, in the end they could inform how it worked but they themselves lost the knowledge that accumulated one step at a time with each iteration. In essence they knew how but very few could tell why! The "why" was acquitted to deities.

Majority of the `Vyasas and Naad Yogies` didn't believe written word could ever replace the rigor and authenticity of recital. Some beneficiaries of spoken layer, even announced that efforts to ‘jail’ the wisdom into written symbols was downright demonic. Somewhat like central banks' nervousness towards crypto protocols these days! Though writing meant lot more content could be scribed, and passed on to far-flung places; but the act of writing (and reading) wouldn't invoke elemental powers — they thought! Their arguments, sometimes, sounding sheer absurdities -  how would you send the homage ,  the butter (`ghee`), fruits and milk to the deities without proper ritual? Other times the arguments were even more vicious - they thought that the written words were sent by the demons of future for they always invoked concepts and ideas that were unthinkable in the past. As if spoken word was truth, written word was a fantasy.

The "recital-model" saw many generations of `Vaśiṣṭhas` and had attained full saturation in the society by the time of `Parāśara's` birth. One of the reason it warranted a lash-back was - somehow, the ritual had gotten more important than the content. While writing had no payback, chanting meant they could perform the rites for the kings and the rich, in lieu of ‘necessities and niceties’. Rich were mandated to perform rites at least sixteen times through their life span — birth, marriage and death being the major milestone rituals. In addition, every year, they must perform a rite for the peace of their dead — `Shradha`. Kings had even more rituals at their hands. In all, it was a flourishing economy of rituals and ritual makers.  Priests were more important than a family physician ! Kings didn't even take on a simple journey without consulting their spiritual `guru`. The organised religion was still a thing of future but the clout many leading reciters enjoyed was a beginning of faith intermingling with politics. The nexus of politics and faith is a vicious cycle for they feed on each other. Reciters were turning into the gate keepers of power.

Writing, on the other hand, had no such incentive. There was no kindle book store, no way to barter the text. It did have a promise to democratize the information and that did appeal to some, but such people were few and far. Most felt a commoner had no reason to access the `Vaidik` knowledge without a qualified gate keeper. And most thought the job of a `Vyasa` was eternal — fully protected till the end of humanity - immortal. Those who didn't believe in rituals and thus by extension defied the `Vaidik` wisdom were named `Asuras` — a class of outspoken people just short of being a monster (`Rakshsa`).

New rituals were being added left right and center. A new ritual if you want to enter a new home. Another if you bought a horse and a cart. Yet another to start the harvest.  Sages developing distinct artifacts of knowledge `Rishies`, somewhat like PhDs of our times, weren't entirely happy in current arrangement. They were not sure if adding more rituals was the right path forward. People who had attained demonstrable mastery in a specific field or indigenously developed a new area of research `Maharishies`, often got most of the attention from `Vyasas` — the editors. But new `Rishies` often had problems in getting their work ritualized. It was hard to get attention from the chanting community. As such, they had no way to preserve their work other than scribing it themselves.

## 3.5

`Parāśara` understood and appreciated this growing concern among budding `Rishies`. He also noticed the hardships of writing first-hand, when he scribed his own work `Krishi Parāśara` - the first book on agriculture. His lineage and the work on agriculture won  him a title of `Maharishi` though it cost him better part of his prime. He wanted to invest more time on improving the ‘writing experience’. 

He had one more reason for this desire — his first love — Astrology (`Jyotish`). Astrology was something beyond the spoken means — it needed charting various planets and stars that were hard to capture for any purely spoken language. 

> Astrology (`Jyotish`) is the long old ancestor of modern day cosmology. Most people think astrology's secret sauce is somehow foretelling the future through broad predictions that had apply to almost anyone, but astrology was inherently a deep understanding of space and time. Effect of motion of massive celestial bodies in space-time, on our physical reality — our tiny box. Clues of effect of celestial motion on earthlings were apparent in changing weathers, and it had already found applications in agriculture - the subject of `Parāśara's` early investigation, but he found seasons impacted the moods. There was something in the extra terrestrial that connected deep with the spirit of not only humans but animals too.

Armed with this ultimate spiritual science, he figured out how to predict expression of a specific traits in a new born — with high degree of accuracy. Even today, in India, a priest (`Pandit`) would pictorially draw the state of heavenly bodies at the time of child birth, called `Janmpatri` — a cosmic birth-chart. This document, normally kept as a scroll, details the exact positions of seven main `grahas` (the sun, moon and five main planets), and twenty seven stars `Nakshtras` at the time of birth. It also details the effect of the motion of this system on the subject child's future. It is an important consideration (in many Hindu families) to determine the suitable marital match. 

>Charting the stars and planets was impossible in spoken word. A proper framework of scribing was a necessity!

An accurate practice of this skill, by someone who knew the underlying science of Astrology well, was like controlling the “chromosomal dice”. If someone could predict child's future owing to the effect of cosmic alignment at the time of birth — `Janmpatri`; then s/he could reverse engineer the logic to ascertain the best time to conceive a child for a specific target future -  though such a strategy, also meant long wait for the appropriate planetary alignment — sometimes, many generations in the future. **`Krishna Dwaipayana` was one such awaited child**. His birth was predicated by `Maharishi Parāśara` — the astrologer extraordinaire, and very rightly known as the ‘father of Astrology’. His epic book `Brihat Parāśara Hora Shastra` is considered the starting point of Astrology.

`Maharishi Parāśara` was excited at the prospect of organizing the entire wisdom and he believed written text was the only way to pull off such a miraculous thing. He however had no illusions, he knew scribing the knowledge, might take more than a lifetime — that too if one was sure there exists "one unique righteous path" for all humans. If he was able to ascertain such a path, he must pass on his learning to his son. If his son, building on what he already knew, could further refine (and test) the truth, then that truth must be embedded into every conscious unit as part of the core kernel of knowledge. 

This approach seemed like a much better option than to turn all the `Shruties` into `Smrities` [^shruti]. In that his approach slightly differed from that of his grand father. `Vasishtha` thought that if everyone learnt to scribe, all spoken scriptures would automatically get converted into text for obvious benefits of durability and portability. He believed humans would find better tools in due course. `Parāśara` on the other side took an approach as to why convert entire history. Why not ascertain "ONE" knowledge and scribe only that for that is what is relevant for the next generations.

It was an ambitious and tall order for next generation — `Maharishi` thought — but that would be a worthy heir for his life's toil. He believed fate blessed him the skill of Astrology, to ensure he found such an heir.

## 3.7

There was another reason for this wait. Every generation appeared to get a new version of the ‘core kernel’. Something that made acceptance of newer convictions lot easier. He, himself, was working hard on many inscription strategies that were promising, but still not ready for the prime time, particularly for his generation subsumed in the magic of spoken words. He thought, it would take a generational shift to gain acceptance for these tools. 

Even today, we are not beyond “generational shift”. For example, baby boomers were comfortable with their land lines and emails. It took a generation for the internet to take firm hold particularly with smartphones powered by social media. Baby boomers were happy with their cable TVs. Our generation takes streaming video, as a commodity. We assume smartphones and streaming is for ever, while the Gen Z and Gen Alpha may wonder how could people block their hands — the most important organs of human body, with smartphones. Why would someone watch stuff on a tiny five inch screen when VR allows them to jump right into the experience? The next generations will have implants to let them talk, walk and work simultaneously.  Their reality may seem like a virtual reality to us, just the way our way of life is living in a VR for people three generations back. With every generation, new tools become effortless and universally acceptable simply because new tools become part of the `Sanskara` - the first steps of learning.

And it wasn't just the tools — the pen and the paper; he must find ways to wrap a payback method around ‘writing’ to make it a sustainable model. And he must steer this ship safe from the ones with vested interests in existing paradigm of spoken rites, because labeling someone `Asura` was easy for the power-brokers — even for a slight clue for non-compliance. Even today, changing the existing power-structure isn't free from risk. Music labels killed Napster. China banned free internet. Central banks hate Cryptos. The play of vested interest is to sustain the past while progress demands efficient innovations at rapid pace. 

> The struggle for innovation is slightly more nuanced than what appears on the surface. We normally think that the fight is between past that wants status quo verses the future generations who seek the obvious advantage of new technology. But the truth is the fight is always with in the variants of new tech. Whenever new manifests, it always comes with many possibilities . In this case, while on the surface it appeared that the `Rakshas` (who wanted to retain the jungle rule) were fighting the ones who wanted a civil way of life (through storage of knowledge); but the truth is power struggle was with in the civilized world -  the vocal "maximalists" verses the writing "aficionados". 
>
> There are umpteen examples of this in our world. The war was between Mac and PC - both trying to usher in a new era of personal computers. It was between iOS and Android both trying to bring in smart phones for daily use. And it is between Bitcoin and Ether - both trying to bring in digital assets to mainstreams. Every new technology manifests with it's own mirror image just like every mass-ful particle comes with it's own anti-particle. The play of `Vishnu` and `Siva` is eternal.

`Maharishi Parāśara` saw this truth. He understood there was a growing disagreement between `Naad` and `Nyaan Yogies` and the apparent bone of contention was the `text`. But that was not his first concern, for he must let the duality play itself out to establish a self sustaining equilibrium.

The main concern  of `Maharishi`,  his primary focus was to find the true righteous path that when scribed (or spoken), actually made a difference in ordinary peoples' life. His focus was not "how", it was on "why"!

## research and notes:

[^chakra]: Chakra System and Hathyoga
- In `Hath Yoga`, human energy system is said to have seven interference points called `Chakras`. The bottom most `Chakra` is called `Mool-adhara` - the `Chakra` of `Sanskara`. Rising from the bottom are `Swadhishthana`, `Manipuraka`,`Anahata`, `Vishudhi`, `Ajna`, and `Sahsrara`. 
- At the time of birth, the energy is situated at the bottom most `Chakra`. During the course of life, just like animals, energy rises to second `Chakra` for procreation and to the third for consumption. Humans have the capabilities to raise energy to fourth and fifth points that enable them to have compassion and communication. These two qualities formulate the knowledge graph and are relevant for `Naad` and `Nyaan Yogies`. 
- Rise of energy beyond this point is possible only through intervention by spiritual `Guru` who uses sixth point `Ajna` to invoke her energy into disciples. A relevant point for the `Bhakti Yogies`. 
- The last point `Sahsrara` is the final destination for `Hath Yogies`. This is where `Karm Yoga` is said to invoke itself. `Sahsrara` means one thousand. Humans are said to have fifty traits - `Vritties` , each with it's own mirror image. Every `Vritti` expresses itself through ten senses. Thus each `Vritti` has twenty expressions. Mind `Chakra` thus controls one thousand expressions. One who has full control on all the thousand expressions is said to be a `Karm Yogi`. However, accessing `Karm Yoga` through this approach is like walking on the water. Managing one thousand variables on 24 by 7 basis is almost impossible. There must be a better way! 

---

[^shruti]: `Shruti` meant the spoken word when the humans used to sustain knowledge, only in the vocal format. Maybe because scribing was difficult. With the advent of writing tools, many `Shruties` were scribed. In essence the scriptures were born out of `Shruties`. The words that got written down, entered the collective memory of humanity.  Such written down early scriptures were called `Smrities`. For example `Manu Smriti` is among the oldest written down scripture, trans-encoded from `Shruti` to `Smriti`. The Sanskrit word `Shruti` got deformed into `Shutri` in Hindi with passage of time. It is important to bear in mind that every thing that we talk (chatter) is NOT `Shruti`. `Shruties` were consciously identified pieces of wisdom, preserved through formal recital to enable passage of knowledge from one generation to the next.

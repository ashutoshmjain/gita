Sun had already gone down as king hurried to the docks. `Maharishi` had suggested many times to have the king spend a night at `Ashram` for finding a return passage at this hour might be difficult. Boats stop plying with the sun set. Little did he know that king had already planned his return. 

As they reached closer to the bank, king could see a single boat. And he got the unmistakable  musky smell as the wind turned a corner towards them. `Satyawati` had asked `Dashraaj's` youngest daughter `Saryu`, who still worked on the boat, to return back home with gold coins for she didn't want to have the gold coins on them as the evening approached. The older sisters were already married in nearby village. `Saryu` offered to stay back though she wanted to be the one to handover Gold to her father. `Satyawati` was sure `Dashraj` must be celebrating the unexpected bounty by now with his undercover `Asura` friends who stayed in the village having received the immunity from `Maharishi`. She told `Saryu` to let `Dashraj` know she might be very late for she had promised the rich farmer a passage back, and she was anyway used to be on the river in nights. It was not the first time `Satyawati` decided to stay back on the waters. Many of such nights she been to the island, alone, rekindling the memories of her days with `Maharishi` and `Krishna`. Her hopes of seeing them again diminished as the time passed. Sometimes, she wondered, if those days actually happened. Ten years was a long time and each day was a battle with herself. She wondered the moment we get everything we ever wanted - in her case beauty, fragrance and success - we immediately start craving for something else. She also noted that her cravings slowed down as the time passed. They were always at the back but she learnt to live with them and now she was probably ready to move on. 

She was quite surprised when she saw the farmer being escorted by three `Yogies`. She already knew he wasn't an ordinary man for no one would gift gold for a boat ride but the fact that he was escorted by `Yogies` meant he was lot more than his appearance. She thought to herself - Who exactly is he? Then she saw a boy walking behind them. His dark complexion mixing with the ensuing darkness of the evening. Her heart skipped a beat for a premonition told her it was `Krishna` - her son.

The older `Yogies` knew her well from their frequent visits to the village and they had taken her boat number of times to cross the river; but `Maharishi` had made sure he and `Krishna` never crossed her path. If this is `Krishna`, why did `Maharishi` send him this time. Is there a message? - She was still wondering when one of the older `Yogi` bowed to her and asked - `Maa` (means mother but this is a standard way for `Yogies` to address older women), are you planning a ride across the river ?

`Satyawati` woke up from her thoughts - Yes `Yogi` - do you all want to go across ?

No `Maa`, only `Maharaaj` would like to go back to his camp on the other side. We are happy to come with you, should you need someone with you on your return. Or we may wait here till you come back. - said the `Yogi`.

That won't be necessary `Yogi`. `Yamuna` is like my mother! I am safer with her than any place on earth - `Satyawati` smiled - btw, you said `Maharaaj`? Of where? - `Satyawati` asked folding her hands.

`Yogi` almost bit his tongue. He didn't realize that `Shantanu` was under cover and the thought that he blew king's cover hit him like a brick. 

`Krishna` quickly understood the situation. He was about to speak but `Shantanu` stopped him with gesture of his right hand. 

`Devi` (a common address for an upper class woman), I am `Shantanu`, king of `Kuru` Kingdom - He said, knowing there was no harm in losing his cover. In fact, he thanked the fate for making it easy to let his true identity be revealed to `Satyawati`. For one he was tired of playing the "hide and seek" through out the day, second he did want `Satyawati` to know who he was. It had be hard to reveal it himself. That would seem as if he was trying  to impress her with his position though he actually wanted to do exactly that.

`Satyawati` didn't know how to react. He had the most powerful king right in font of her and possibly her long separated son too. She remembered the words of `Maharishi` - You will rule the world. 

She almost sat down by the weight of the moment. She had thought about `Maharishi's` words almost every day since she left him and Krishna behind, but she didn't realize the physical truth would be so much bigger, and so abrupt, and shocking. 

`Krishna` moved a step closer and held her hand. Being a child it felt okay for him to hold the hand of a woman almost her mother's age. He didn't know yet he was holding his real mother. 

And who are you `Yogi`, never seen you around - `Satyawati` asked to reconfirm her premonition. 

I am `Krishna` `Maa` - Son of `Maharishi Parāśara` - said Krishna, oblivious to all that had transpired to get to this moment in time.

And who is your mother `Krishna` - `Satyawati` wanted to see if her son knew his own roots. When she saw `Krishna's` face blanking out, she asked - How would you know everything that is there to know without knowing who you are?

A simple question, yet so profound. `Yogies` left the banks as king and `Satyawati` boarded the boat. On his way back, `Krishna` thought why did `Maharishi` never brought the topic of his mother. Why such a simple truth is hidden from humans. Why don't we automatically know our lineage? - our oldest history.

Any other child would have rushed to his father to know who was his mother. But `Krishna` was no ordinary child. That night, `Krishna` climbed his favorite tall tree and sat there. This was his den when difficult questions troubled his child mind. If `Maharishi` sought not to tell this simple thing, there must be a reason. But more importantly does every manifestation hides something? Is Sun and the moon and the mother Earth that we perceive hide something behind the perceivable. If that was true, would it be right to say bigger the manifestation, bigger was the hidden truth? Then what is the biggest manifestation of all? Isn't it the human body itself, that perceives everything? What does this body hides behind it? Is it what `Maharishi` calls `Atma`. He didn't know when he slept, on the tree. Many questions still unanswered but he knew what to ask. And he also knew truth must reveal itself if we asked the right questions. `Maharishi` had told him never to seek answers. Instead, seek the right questions!

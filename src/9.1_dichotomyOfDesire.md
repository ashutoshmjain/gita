How o find if I am under influence of desire of I am involved in actions. Simple and fool proof rule is to ask if I can do whatever I wanna do without asking anyone to help ? If yes than it is an action. If I need someone else to do something before I could do my thing, than there is a desire. My actions are contingent on that desire. This is what we need to remove.

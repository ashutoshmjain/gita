The purpose for **Converting Bhagavad-gītā into English poetry**, albeit through AI, is to make its profound teachings more accessible, engaging, and emotionally resonant for a wider English-speaking audience, particularly next generation. Gita is immutable, but the metaphores used to explain dense topics must be time and place specific. That is where tools like Gemini Deep Search and notebookLM come in handy.

The original [Sanskrit](https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_giitaa/bhagvadnew.html) verses are compiled into English Poetry using Google's Gemini, and then rendered as a podcast with NotebookLM .

Show is available through  any podcasting app that supports [Podcast Index 2.0](https://podcastindex.org/podcast/7267041)

For best listening experience, please visit chapter pages by clicking the  cheeseburger on top left <i class="fa fa-fw fa-bars"></i> . There, you can listen to Spotify feed while reading the verses.
